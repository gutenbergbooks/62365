<h2><a name="pageiii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
iii</span>PREFACE.</h2>
<p>Materials for a history of Lynn have been collected as long
ago as the reign of Charles II. by <i>Guybon Goddard</i>, then
recorder of this town, and brother-in-law of Sir William
Dugdale.&nbsp; At his death, which happened, if we are not
mistaken, about 1677, those materials came into the possession of
his son Tho. Goddard Esq; from whom our corporation soon after
endeavoured to obtain them; but we cannot learn that they then
succeeded; nor does it appear that they ever came into their
hands.&nbsp; What became of them, whether still in being or not,
we have never been able to learn: and it is presumed that all the
present members of our body Corporate are equally
uninformed.&nbsp; See p. 831.</p>
<p>About forty years after the death of Guybon Goddard, another
attempt was made to produce or compile a history of this town, by
a nameless person, but evidently a learned, ingenious, and
industrious man.&nbsp; Unfortunately his attention was chiefly
engaged about the churches, and especially <a
name="pageiv"></a><span class="pagenum">p. iv</span>the monuments
and monumental inscriptions which they contained.&nbsp; These he
took no small pains with, and made fair drawings of most of
them.&nbsp; This work he carefully arranged, and fairly wrote
out.&nbsp; It forms a moderate folio volume, and is now in the
possession, or at least in the hands, of Mr. <i>Thomas King</i>
of this town, for we are informed that Dr. <i>Adams</i> is the
real owner of it.&nbsp; There are at the end of it some curious
documents relating to divers ancient customs and occurrences, of
which the compiler of the present history has in some measure
availed himself.&nbsp; The volume was finished in 1724, and the
author, it seems, died soon after.</p>
<p>Within a few years after his death, the work fell into the
hands of Mr. B. <i>Mackerell</i>, who, after making a few paltry
additions to it, actually published the greatest part of it
verbatim under his own name, and it constitutes the bulk of that
volume which has ever since been called, <i>Mackerell&rsquo;s
History of Lynn</i>.&nbsp; This act or achievement is
disreputable to Mackerell&rsquo;s memory; but the plagiarism has
been scarcely known or noticed till now.&nbsp; He makes, in his
preface, some slight obscure mention of the MS. but deigns not to
tell the author&rsquo;s name, though it must have been well known
to him.&nbsp; He also boasts of his having had free access to the
<i>town records</i>, and having &ldquo;diligently searched and
perused them, for a considerable time together.&rdquo;&nbsp; For
aught we know, this may be all very true; but if it be so, he <a
name="pagev"></a><span class="pagenum">p. v</span>must have
laboured to very small purpose, as all the discoveries he has
been able to make amount to very little, and may be comprised
within a very narrow compass.</p>
<p><i>Parkin</i> also, in his <i>continuation of
Bloomfield&rsquo;s History of Norfolk</i>, and in his
<i>Topography of Freebridge Hundred and Half</i>, has published a
history of Lynn, of above fifty large folio pages.&nbsp; It is in
few hands, and little known; and though it contains much useful
information, (very ill arranged,) it has no pretension to the
character of a complete history of the town.&nbsp; The same may
be said of what has since appeared, in the octavo history of
Norfolk published at Norwich, and, more recently, in the Norfolk
Tour, and the Beauties of England; the former from the pen of Mr.
<i>Beatniffe</i>, and the latter from that of Mr.
<i>Britton</i>.&nbsp; All these are mere Epitomes, and never fail
to excite in their readers a wish to see a more copious and
complete history of the place.&nbsp; Such a wish has been often
and very generally expressed; and some years ago, a young man, of
the name of <i>Delamore</i>, offered to gratify it, and supply
this deficiency and lack of service.&nbsp; He accordingly
circulated printed proposals for publishing, by subscription, a
larger account of the town than any that had yet appeared.&nbsp;
But not meeting with sufficient encouragement, he dropt the
design, and soon after quitted this vicinity.&nbsp; What
materials he possessed, or how competent he was for the
undertaking, the present writer is not able <a
name="pagevi"></a><span class="pagenum">p. vi</span>to say.&nbsp;
But it is very clear that the public were not disposed to favour
his proposal.</p>
<p>For some years after the last mentioned occurrence, there was
no talk or expectation of a new history of Lynn.&nbsp; But
somewhat more than seven years ago, a sudden and severe domestic
affliction (from the effects of which he has never recovered)
obliged the present writer to seek in solitude some alleviation
of his sorrow, which he despaired of finding in the way of social
intercourse, and even found himself incapable of attempting it,
without offering unbearable violence to his feelings.&nbsp; Thus
shut up in retirement, and buried among books, he tried to
beguile his melancholy, by forming and pursuing certain literary
projects; among which was an <i>ecclesiastical history of
Wales</i>, which had often before employed his thoughts; and
likewise a <i>general history of Lynn</i>, which has been his
place of residence now near forty years, and whose history had
also, not unfrequently, engaged his attention.&nbsp; In both
these works he made some progress; which coming to the knowledge
of his friends, they urged him to publish, but they were not
agreed which should be published first: some called for the
former work, of which some hundreds of copies were soon
subscribed for; others advised him to complete and publish the
History of Lynn first, and these prevailed&mdash;it being more
convenient for him just then to attend to this than to the
other.&nbsp; An agreement was consequently made with one of the
book-sellers <a name="pagevii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
vii</span>for its publication; and the public manifested a
disposition to encourage the undertaking.</p>
<p>When the work was sent to the press, it was fully intended
that it should all be comprised in one volume; and this intention
was persisted in, till 7 or 800 pages had been printed off.&nbsp;
By that time the author had received a large and unexpected
quantity of new matter, much of it very curious and interesting,
which many of his subscribers wished him to make use of and
insert.&nbsp; He was therefore induced and constrained to depart
from his original design, and extend the work to two
volumes.&nbsp; But as it was then too late to have the pages
numbered accordingly, they were of course continued in a regular
series through both volumes, so as to amount in all to above
1200.</p>
<p>The enlargement or extension of the work, beyond the original
design, has occasioned some derangement of the author&rsquo;s
first plan, so as to give the latter part of the work somewhat of
the appearance of disorder and confusion; which the author
sincerely regrets, but it was perhaps unavoidable, as the case
stood.&nbsp; Had he possessed at first all the materials he has
since obtained, he flatters himself that the task he undertook
had been much better executed.&nbsp; Some of the latter or lately
received documents were found to cast a new light on divers facts
previously stated, so as to convince the author that he had been
in several <a name="pageviii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
viii</span>instances mistaken.&nbsp; He therefore never failed to
seize the earliest opportunity to rectify those mistakes; for he
was fully resolved to make his history the vehicle of truth, as
far as it lay in his power.&nbsp; Of this he thinks he has given
frequent proofs.&nbsp; Yet even this very practice, of
rectifying, without loss of time, any mistakes which he found he
had previously fallen into, will probably be classed, by some,
among the defects of this performance.&nbsp; Be it so.&nbsp; He
is more desirous of being classed among honest men, and lovers of
truth, than among polished writers, or methodical and elegant
historians.</p>
<p>As to the <span class="smcap">Critics</span>, <i>annual</i>,
and <i>quarterly</i>, as well as <i>monthly</i>, he has but
little to say to them.&nbsp; He is very sensible of the defects
of the work; many of which however were unavoidable, in existing
circumstances, or in a first attempt like his, where many of the
necessary materials were not in his possession, or at his
command, and seemed for a long while unobtainable.&nbsp; Should
the work come before their high tribunal, he asks no
favour.&nbsp; They will doubtless see in it many defects, but not
more perhaps than he is himself conscious of.&nbsp; They are
welcome however to be as severe as they please, provided they
deal fairly, or with reason and justice.&nbsp; It may be less
cruel to exercise their severity here, than upon some young
authors, who are in quest of, and panting for popular applause,
or literary fame; neither of which has ever been sought for by
the present writer.</p>
<p><a name="pageix"></a><span class="pagenum">p. ix</span>The
work being now finished, after many unforeseen delays, the author
respectfully submits it to the examination and judgment of the
candid and intelligent reader, by whom, he doubts not, both its
merits and demerits will be rightly estimated.&nbsp; Whatever may
be said or thought of the execution, he thinks it must be
admitted, that there is here brought together such a mass of
interesting information relating to this town, as few people
could have expected to see, when the design of this publication
was first advertised.&nbsp; So that there may now be obtained as
much knowledge of the ancient and modern affairs of this town, as
of most towns in the county, or in the kingdom.&nbsp; He regrets
that so many typographical errors escaped him in revising the
sheets; the chief of which he has now pointed out, in a table of
errata, (which will be found in each volume,) by the direction of
which he requests the subscribers forthwith to correct the
reading.</p>
<p>It may have been expected, that this work would contain a
<i>list of our mayors</i>; but as no such list was known of, that
might be depended upon for its correctness, it has been omitted:
nor did it seem to be at all material, unless it had also been
accompanied with lists of the <i>recorders</i>, and other
functionaries, which appeared unobtainable.&mdash;It was intended
to add an <i>alphabetical Index</i>; but as it would take up some
time, and increase too much the size of the concluding number,
(already almost three times as large at <a name="pagex"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. x</span>any of the others,) the design was
given up.&nbsp; The <i>Table of contents</i> it is hoped, will
supply, in a great measure, the want of an index.&nbsp; Be that
as it may, the work is now left to take its chance and make its
own way in the world&mdash;the author consoling himself with the
consciousness of having faithfully and honestly performed the
task he had undertaken.</p>

that of Wisbeach&mdash;Ancient and present state of its

<h4><span class="smcap">Section</span> I.</h4>
<p class="gutsumm"><i>Situation of the town&mdash;its distance
from the sea</i>, <i>&amp;c.&mdash;its harbour&mdash;river Ouse
and its tributary streams</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Lynn</span> is situated on the eastern
side of Marshland, and of the Great Level, or Fen Country, about
12 miles from the Sea, 42 from Norwich, 46 from Cambridge, and 98
from London. <a name="citation1"></a><a href="#footnote1"
class="citation">[1]</a>&nbsp; It stands partly on each side of
the Ouse, but chiefly on its eastern banks; though it is supposed
to have stood originally all on the opposite shore, and hence
that part of it is still called <i>Old Lynn</i>.</p>
<p><a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>The Haven
or Harbour is capacious, but the entrance to it is accounted
somewhat difficult, and even dangerous, owing to the numerous
sandbanks, and the frequent shiftings of the channel, occasioned
by the loose and light nature of the sandy and silty soil at the
bottom.&nbsp; On which account it is not deemed safe for ships to
go in or out without pilots, who are, or ought always to be well
acquainted with the variations and actual state of the
channel.&nbsp; In the ages proceeding the 13th century this
harbour, compared with its present width, is said to have been
very narrow, being only a few perches over, though its depth of
water was then, probably, no less, if not greater than it is at
present.</p>
<p>The Ouse over against the town, is reckoned about as wide as
the Thames above London Bridge.&nbsp; Its name is evidently of
British origin, <a name="citation2"></a><a href="#footnote2"
class="citation">[2]</a> and corresponds with those of several
others of our rivers; such as the <i>Usk</i>, <i>Esk</i>,
<i>Ex</i>, <i>Isis</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i>&nbsp; The word signifies,
a <i>stream</i>, or <i>the river</i>, by way of eminence.&nbsp;
It is called the <i>great Ouse</i>, to distinguish it from that
called the <i>little</i> or <i>lesser Ouse</i>, which is now one
of its tributary streams, and joins it some way below <i>Ely</i>,
though it had formerly no connection with it.&nbsp; It is also
called the <i>eastern Ouse</i>, to distinguish it from the
<i>northern</i>, or Yorkshire river of the same name.</p>
<p>As Lynn owes most of its consequence to this river, which
forms its communication with the sea, and gives it so great an
extent of inland navigation, and consequently <a
name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>such a vast
commercial intercourse with the interior parts of the country, it
will not be improper here to give some account of it, together
with its principal branches, or those tributary streams which
render it so considerable among the British navigable rivers.</p>
<p><i>Kinderley</i>, many years ago, has given the following
account of this river and its several branches: &ldquo;The Ouse
(says he) formerly <i>Usa or Isa</i>, which is the most famous of
all the rivers that pass through this Level, has its original
head on a gentle rising ground full of springs, under Sisam in
Northamptonshire, 54 miles from Erith bridge, at which place it
first touches the Isle of Ely.&nbsp; It falls by Brackley,
Buckingham, Newport Pagnel, Bedford, Huntingdon, and St. Ives, to
Erith, and so on till it comes to Lynn.&nbsp; It has 5 rivers
emptying themselves into it, beside many brooks and rills;
<i>Grant</i>, <i>Mildenhall</i>, <i>Brandon</i>, <i>Stoke</i>,
and the river <i>Lenne</i>, or Sandringham Ea [otherwise
<i>Nare</i>,] which rises under Lycham, and comes by Castleacre,
Narford, and Sechy.&rdquo;&nbsp; [He omits the <i>Nene</i>, which
surely he ought to have mentioned.]&nbsp; Afterward he adds,
&ldquo;That the Ouse by its situation, and having so many
navigable rivers falling into it from eight several counties,
does therefore afford a great advantage to trade and commerce,
since hereby two cities, and several great towns are therein
served; as Peterborough, Ely, Stamford, Bedford, St. Ives,
Huntingdon, St. Neots, Northampton, Cambridge, Bury St. Edmunds,
Thetford, &amp;c. with all sorts of heavy commodities from Lynn,
as Coals, Salt, Deals, Fir-timber, Iron, Pitch, Tar, and Wine,
thither <a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
4</span>imported; and from these parts great quantities of Wheat,
Rye, Coleseed, Barley, &amp;c. are brought down these rivers,
whereby a great foreign and inland trade is carried on, and the
breed of seamen is increased.&nbsp; The Port of Lynn supplies
<i>six</i> counties wholly, and <i>three</i> in part.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But of the Ouse and the other Lynn rivers, no one, perhaps,
has given so full and so good an account as Mr. <i>Skrine</i>, in
his general account of the British rivers.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The Ouse (he says,) traverses a very
considerable part of the Midland counties of England, rising in
two branches, not far from Brackley and Towcester on the borders
of Northamptonshire and Oxfordshire, from whence its course is
eastward, a little inclined to the north, through
Buckinghamshire, joined at Newport Pagnel by a small stream from
Ivinghoe in the south; to reach Bedford it descends by many
windings toward the south, and then joined by the <i>Hyee</i>
from Woburn, and the <i>Ivel</i> from Biggleswade, it pursues its
original direction to Huntingdon, where a combination of streams
from the south-west contributes to its increase.&nbsp; From
thence it passes nearly eastward through the centre of the Fens
of Cambridgeshire, where it receives the <i>Cam</i> near Ely from
the south-west, and afterwards the <i>lesser Ouse</i> from
Woolpit and Ixworth in the south-east, joined by the <i>Larke</i>
from Bury St. Edmunds; it then inclines more and more to the
north, till it falls into the great Gulph of the sea between the
projecting coasts of Norfolk and Lincolnshire, beneath the walls
of Lynn Regis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Ouse is generally a stagnant stream, neither giving
<a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>nor
receiving much beauty in all the great tract through which it
passes.&nbsp; Its course is uniformly dull and unimportant to
Buckingham; nor is it at all an object from the princely
territory of <i>Stowe</i>, which abounds in grand scenes and
buildings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This river &ldquo;does not improve much,&rdquo; (he further
observes) &ldquo;as it traverses the plain counties of Bedford
and Huntingdon, though it adds some consequence to their
capitals, being there navigable; at St. Ives it sinks into those
great marshes which abound on this part of the eastern coast,
through Norfolk, Huntingdonshire, Cambridgeshire,
Northamptonshire and Lincolnshire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <i>Hyee</i> which meets it a little below Bedford,
passes near the Duke of Bedford&rsquo;s noble domain at Woburn
Abbey, and the <i>Ivel</i> flows northward to it through a dull
uninteresting tract of country.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <i>Cam</i> is composed of two branches, one of
which rises on the borders of Bedfordshire, and unites with the
other, which bears the classic name of <i>Granta</i>, flowing
from the confines of Essex, through the highly ornamented grounds
of Audley End.&nbsp; They unite near Cambridge, and then run
nearly eastward till the Ouse receives them, a little way from
Ely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <i>Cam</i> receives no small portion of beauty from
the academical shades of Cambridge, being crossed by bridges from
most of the principal Colleges, whose gardens join the public
walks on its banks, which are finely planted and laid out.&nbsp;
The stream itself is but stagnant <a name="page6"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 6</span>and muddy, yet it adds something to
the peculiar traits of the landscape, with the several stone
bridges; nor do the fronts of the colleges, as they appear in
succession, intermixed with thick groves, any where shew
themselves to such advantage.&nbsp; The Area in front of Clare
Hall, and the new building of King&rsquo;s College, with its
superb chapel, matchless in that species of Gothic Architecture
which has been called &ldquo;<i>the improved</i>,&rdquo; exhibit
one of the most striking displays in England.&nbsp; Soon
afterward the Cam sinks into the Fens, where the proud pile and
towers of Ely Cathedral appear finely elevated over the level,
just above the junction of the Cam and the Ouse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A dreary tract of Marsh accompanies these united rivers
to Downham in Norfolk; nor does the country much improve
afterwards, but the channel becomes very considerable, and the
exit of these rivers is splendid, where the flourishing port and
great trade of Lynn present a croud of vessels.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To the above account by Skrine, which is but imperfect, other
rivers might be added, which join the Ouse in the latter part of
its progress, and which ought not to be left here unnoticed; as
the <i>Nene</i>, from Peterborough, Whittlesea, and March; the
<i>Wissey</i> or <i>Winson</i>, from Stoke, and the <i>Lenne</i>
or <i>Nare</i>, from Narborough and Sechhithe.&nbsp; The former,
a large branch of which joins the Ouse at Salter&rsquo;s Lode, is
a Northamptonshire river, and rises near Catesby, under Anby
Hill, in that county, and making Northampton in its way, passes
from thence to Wellingborough, and along <a
name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>by Higham
Ferrers, Thrapston, Oundle, Walmsford or Wandesford, Castor,
Peterborough, Whittlesea, March, and on to Salter&rsquo;s Lode
and Lynn.&nbsp; The Wissey or Winson rises in the neighbourhood
of Necton and Bradenham, in Norfolk, and running by Pickingham,
Cressingham, Ikborough, Northwould, Stoke, and Helgay, enters the
Ouse some way above Downham.&nbsp; The Lenne or Nare, otherwise
Sandringham Ea, is also a Norfolk river, which after running by
Litcham, Lexham, Castleacre, Westacre, Narford, Narborough,
Pentney, and Sechhithe enters the Ouse at the South or upper end
of the town of Lynn.&nbsp; It is a narrow, but in some places a
deep and rapid river, and navigable a good way into the country;
but has no very beautiful or striking sceneries any where upon or
near its banks. <a name="citation7"></a><a href="#footnote7"
class="citation">[7]</a>&nbsp; Like all the rivers of this low,
flat, and dull country, it presents nothing that can be called
striking or very remarkable, unless it be, a perpetual
succession, or uniformity of dullness.</p>

Ouse diverted from its ancient course and outlet&mdash;King
John&rsquo;s disastrous passage over that river</i>, <i>in his
last progress from Lynn&mdash;Extract from Vancouver</i>.</p>
<p>In the respectable work called The Beauties of England, this
remarkable circumstance is quoted from <i>Walsingham</i> relating
to the river Ouse&mdash;That on the first of January 1399 it
suddenly ceased to flow between the villages of Snelson and
Harrold near Bedford, leaving its channel so bare of water that
the people walked at the bottom for full three miles. <a
name="citation8"></a><a href="#footnote8"
class="citation">[8]</a>&nbsp; So strange a phenomenon seems not
very easy to account for.&nbsp; It is said to have been for a
long time considered as <i>ominous</i> of those dire dissentions
and bloody wars which the opposite claims of the rival Houses of
York and Lancaster shortly afterward occasioned.&nbsp; Nor is it
at all wonderful that such an idea should gain credit in those
dark and superstitious times: but to men of enlightened minds it
must appear a very idle and pitiful conceit.&nbsp; A Dr. Childrey
endeavoured to account for the said phenomenon, by supposing the
stream above to have been congealed by a sudden frost: but this
also is very properly deemed untenable by the writers of the work
above mentioned; and they assign, as the most probable cause, in
their opinion, that the earth had suddenly sunk in some part of
the channel, so as to form there a deep and capacious cavity,
into which the waters flowed till it was filled up, <a
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>leaving the
channel below in the mean time nearly dry, so that people might
then actually walk at the bottom, as the story asserts.&nbsp;
This appears reasonable enough, and was probably the real case;
but as it cannot be now very interesting there seems no need to
investigate it any further.</p>
<p>Dull and uninspiring, and in no sense classical ground, or a
favourite haunt of the muses, as the banks of the Ouse have been
generally, and perhaps justly considered, it must not be
forgotten that they are become of late entitled to no small
portion of celebrity, by the distinguished productions of the
ingenious and excellent <span class="smcap">Cowper</span>, one of
the best, if not the very best of all our English poets of these
latter days.&nbsp; He spent the greatest part of his time, and
composed most of his works in the vicinity of this river.&nbsp;
Henceforth it may therefore be deemed a classic stream: but it
will be long, perhaps, before its banks shall have again the
honour of numbering among their inhabitants a poet or a man of
equal worth, genius, or renown. <a name="citation9"></a><a
href="#footnote9" class="citation">[9]</a></p>
<p>Here it may be proper further to observe, that the Ouse did
not always visit Lynn, or pass that way in its progress to the
Ocean.&nbsp; In ancient times its course is said to have been by
Wisbeach, to which that town probably owes its name: <i>Wis</i>,
or <i>Wys</i>, being apparently <a name="page10"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 10</span>but another name of the <i>Ouse</i>,
and <i>Wisbeach</i> the very same thing with <i>Ousebeach</i>,
and signifying the beach, side, or bank of the Ouse; in other
words, a place or town on the Shore and near the mouth of that
river. <a name="citation10"></a><a href="#footnote10"
class="citation">[10]</a></p>
<p>What diverted this river from its ancient and original course
is said to have been a great inland flood, which, meeting with
obstruction, choked up the channel (already become bad and
neglected) broke over the banks, and deluged the fens to a vast
extent; from the effects of which they have never been fully
recovered to this day.</p>
<p>This flood so deprived of a passage to the sea by the usual
channel, and consequently overflowing the adjacent country to a
great depth, became a most grievous and ruinous annoyance to the
Fen people.&nbsp; At last, in order to remove so unbearable and
terrible a nuisance, instead of taking common sense for their
guide, and following nature, by opening the channel to the
ancient <a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>outfall at Wisbeach, they determined, seemingly, to
force nature, and set common-sense at defiance, by opening a
passage for the inundating waters, and consequently for the
future course of the great Ouse, the Cam, and the Larke into the
narrow bed of the lesser Ouse, from Little-port Chair to Priests
Houses, across that ridge, or higher ground, by which nature
seemed to have forbidden the union of these rivers. <a
name="citation11"></a><a href="#footnote11"
class="citation">[11]</a></p>
<p>In this ill judged and preposterous measure most of the
existing evils in regard to the bad state of the Lynn and
Wisbeach Harbours, the inland navigation and the drainage of the
Fens have probably originated.&nbsp; The Ouse and the other
rivers before mentioned have ever since followed the same new and
unnatural track: Nor is it now very likely that they will ever
again be permitted to follow any other.&nbsp; This memorable
event, according to <i>Dugdale</i>, happened in the reign of
Henry the third: so that in the reign of King <i>John</i>, the
great patron of Lynn, the river or body of fresh water which
flowed that way was but very small and narrow; and it was in
crossing the Ouse, which did not then pass by Lynn, that he lost
his baggage and treasures, and probably many of his men.&nbsp;
Ancient records say that it was in crossing <i>Wellstream</i>,
which was then the name of <a name="page12"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 12</span>the Ouse in its approach to Wisbeach
and the Sea, that the said King suffered those losses. <a
name="citation12"></a><a href="#footnote12"
class="citation">[12]</a></p>
<p>The following Extract from <i>Vancouver&rsquo;s</i> <span
class="smcap">Appendix</span> to his <i>Agricultural Report</i>
will serve, it is thought, to corroborate some of the foregoing
observations.&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;From the highlands in Suffolk (between the
Mildenhall and Brandon rivers) to the east of Welney, Outwel,
Emneth, and thence to the sea a positive dividing ground exists,
formed by the hand of nature, strongly marked, and distinctly to
be seen between the waters of the Lynn and of the Wisbeach
Ouse.&nbsp; The hanging level, or natural inclination of the
Country on the north side of this dividing ground draws the
waters off to the sea through the lesser Ouse to the outfall of
Lynn; and on the south side of it draws them off to the sea
through the greater Ouse to the outfall of Wisbeach.&nbsp; To the
cutting through this dividing ground, in order to force the water
of the greater into the lesser Ouse, are all the evils of the
south and middle levels of the fens, and of the country below
originally and solely to be ascribed.&nbsp; At this time the bed
of the Ouse where Denver Sluices now stand, was at least 13 feet
below the general surface of the surrounding country; and then it
was that, by the free action and reaction of the tides the waters
flowed five hours in the haven of Lynn, ascended unto the Stoke
and Brandon rivers, and into other streams which nature had
wisely appropriated to be discharged <a name="page13"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 13</span>through that outfall; forming the bed
of the Ouse to one gradually inclined plain <i>from the junction
of the principal branches of that river into the low country to
the level of the Ocean</i>, <i>very near or in the harbour of
Lynn</i>.&nbsp; The Counteracting this disposition of nature by
forcing a greater quantity of water into the river than it could
discharge into the sea during the time of ebb, necessarily
occasioned the highland and foreign waters to override all those,
which during the time of ebb, would naturally have drained into
the Lynn river, and gave the waters of Buckingham and Bedford an
exit into the sea in preference to those which lay inundating the
country within a few miles, of their natural outfall.&mdash;In
this condition at present are all the lower parts of the country
bordering upon the Lynn Ouse; and the country above Denver
Sluices, Downham, Marshland, and Bardolph fens, exhibits the most
important of many other melancholy examples and evidences of
it.&nbsp; In the higher parts of the country the consequences of
this measure seem to have been severely experienced on the lands
exposed to the unembanked waters of the old Ouse, between
Hermitage and Harrimere.&nbsp; The Old Bedford river was then cut
from Erith to Salter&rsquo;s Lode, as a slaker to the Ouse, to
relieve the country through which the Ouse flowed, from Erith to
Ely.&nbsp; The Ouse waters thus divided a great part of them
descended through the Old Bedford river in a straight line of
twenty miles into the Lynn Ouse.&nbsp; But as that work was
judged insufficient and defective, the New Bedford, or one
hundred foot river was determined upon, and Sluices were erected
at Hermitage to drive all the water of old <a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>Ouse from
Erith (through the One hundred foot) into the Lynn Ouse; but that
river not having sufficient capacity to utter them to sea, they
reverted up the Ouse, the Stoke and Brandon rivers, drowning the
whole of that country, and finally urging the necessity of
erecting Denver Sluices, as the only apparent cure for the evils
with which the country was then oppressed, and seemed further
threatened with.&nbsp; In the execution of this business, with a
view of bringing the bottom of the Ouse on a level with that of
the hundred foot river (which was cut only five feet deep) it was
judged expedient to raise a Dam eight feet high across the bed of
the Ouse, upon the top of which the Sole or base of Denver
Sluices was laid.&nbsp; This measure has not only defeated the
purpose it was designed to promote, but has been the unfortunate
cause of a body of sand and sea sediment being deposited in the
bed of the Lynn Ouse at least eight feet deep at Denver Sluices,
and only terminating in its injurious consequences at the mouth
of the Lynn Channel.&nbsp; This shews to every calm and candid
mind the necessity of duly considering the probable effects of
counteracting the laws of nature, in cases where nature appears
experimentally to have had success on her side.&mdash;From a due
consideration of the obstacles which appear at this time to exist
in what has long been considered the principal outfalling drain
to the Middle and South levels of the fens, it is surely
reasonable to direct our attention to the general inclination of
the country with respect to the sea, and to what has all along
been pointed out by nature as the main outlet thither, for the
waters of the middle and south levels, and see if some <a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>means cannot
yet be devised for recovering the general course of the ancient
and voluntary passage of the waters through their natural channel
of Wisbeach to the sea.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The above passage merits serious and particular
attention.&nbsp; The undisputed and indisputable fact, that the
course of the Ouse lay formerly by Wisbeach, seems a clear and
decisive proof that it was its natural course, and so may be
considered as corroborating a great part at least of the above
reasoning.&nbsp; Upon the whole, therefore, it seems highly
probable that the evils now existing and complained of, as to the
bad state of the Wisbeach and Lynn harbours, the inland
navigation and fen drainage, have mostly originated in the
abovementioned desertion of the Ouse from its ancient and natural
outfall, and the forcing of it to Lynn through the channel of the
lesser Ouse, in the 13th century, and reign of Henry III. as was
before observed.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Section</span> III.</h4>
<p class="gutsumm"><i>Effects of the desertion of the Ouse and
Nene on Wisbeach and parts adjacent</i>.</p>
<p>After the above mentioned disastrous aberration of the Ouse
some plans, it seems, were formed, and royal Commissions issued
to bring it back again into its old deserted channel by Wisbeach,
but all proved in the end ineffectual and fruitless, so that the
port of Wisbeach, of course would be materially injured.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Of old time&rdquo; (says Badeslade&mdash;that is, while
the Ouse and the Nene <a name="page16"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 16</span>discharged themselves that way)
&ldquo;ships of great burden resorted to
Wisbeach&rdquo;&mdash;but after those rivers had deserted their
ancient outlet, that town soon ceased to be accessible to large
vessels.&nbsp; The bed or channel below the town being forsaken
by the said rivers, (or at most occupied only by an
inconsiderable branch of the Nene, which must have been
insufficient to grind or scour it to its former or usual depth,)
would gradually be filled up in time with silt and sand; and
which evidently has been the case.&nbsp; This is confirmed by a
remarkable circumstance related by <i>Dugdale</i>&mdash;That in
deepening the Wisbeach river in 1635, (about 300 years after the
desertion of the Ouse,) &ldquo;the workmen, at eight feet below
the then bottom came to another bottom which was stony, and there
at several distances found seven boats that had lain there
overwhelmed with sand for many ages.&rdquo; <a
name="citation16a"></a><a href="#footnote16a"
class="citation">[16a]</a></p>
<p><i>Atkins</i>, who wrote in 1608, and dedicated his paper to
<i>Andrews</i> bishop of Ely, speaks of the Wisbeach channel as
&ldquo;anciently an arm of the sea;&rdquo; <a
name="citation16b"></a><a href="#footnote16b"
class="citation">[16b]</a> and says that the time was when all
the waters of the Ouse, even those which then passed from
Littleport Chair to Lynn had their passage by <i>Welney</i> and
<i>Well</i> to the North Seas at Wisbeach, and from thence to the
Washes&mdash;and he further observes that writers have said, that
King <i>John&rsquo;s</i> people perished in the <i>Waters of
Well</i>. <a name="citation16c"></a><a href="#footnote16c"
class="citation">[16c]</a>&nbsp; <a name="page17"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 17</span>From Thorney Red Book he also shews,
that <i>Well Stream</i> was an ancient appellation of the
Wisbeach river.&nbsp; He further adds, that this outfall, or arm
of the sea, had Holland and a part of the Isle on one side, and
Marshland on the other; these were defended from it by great
sea-banks, which in the time of Henry VI were ordained to be made
and maintained fifty feet high.&nbsp; Hither of old resorted (he
says) ships and vessels of great burden.&nbsp; But the sea, still
forsaking the Isle, made the whole passage between Wisbeach and
the Washes high marshes and sands; and by the decay of the river,
the channel, or outfall, became so shallow and weak, as to admit
of people often going over on foot, bare legged under the
knees.&nbsp; He also imputes much blame to the people about
Wisbeach, in not scouring and dyking the river, as by ancient
laws and presentments they ought to have done; and not preserving
and maintaining the petty sewers and drains.&nbsp; In consequence
of these omissions, not only the fens were drowned, but the means
were also lost of draining 13 or 14000 acres of inland grounds,
the support of three or four towns on the North of Wisbeach.</p>
<p>That the bad effects of the desertion of the Ouse and Nene
from their ancient outfall at Wisbeach, soon became very grievous
to that town and the adjacent country, appears by the frequent
complaints made, and laws enacted for their relief.&nbsp; Some of
those laws were made in the reign of Henry VI, and measures were
taken, it seems, in consequence of them, for the relief and
benefit <a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>of
the sufferers.&nbsp; The most important and beneficial of all
those measures appears to be that adopted toward the latter part
of the 15th century under the direction of bishop <i>Morton</i>.
<a name="citation18"></a><a href="#footnote18"
class="citation">[18]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;That prelate finding (says
Atkins) that beside its being a very chargeable course to his
people of the hundred of Wisbeach, once in four or five years to
dyke this river, and that notwithstanding this dyking of the
river, the outfall below to the seaward nevertheless decayed; and
finding that without a great head of fresh waters, to scour both
the river and the outfall, all would be lost, took a part of
<i>Hercules&rsquo; labour</i> upon him, and strove to bring in
great abundance of fresh waters, by divers courses, out of the
Fens, to maintain this channel: viz. the rivers Nene and Welland
from <i>Southea</i>, and the river of the great cross, or
Plantwater, from the united branches of Nene and Ouse, descending
by <i>Benwick</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; But the bishop&rsquo;s principal
undertaking seems to have been the cut of 14 miles, from
Peterborough to Guyhorn, by which a large portion of the Nene was
brought down <a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span>to Wisbeach, and proved of up small benefit to that town
and harbour, as well as to the drainage of the country.&nbsp;
This cut has transmitted the bishop&rsquo;s name deservedly and
honourably to posterity; it being ever since known and
distinguished under the denomination of <i>Morton&rsquo;s
Leam</i>.&nbsp; Happy had it been for the world, if all those of
his order had deserved so well of their neighbours and of their
country. <a name="citation19"></a><a href="#footnote19"
class="citation">[19]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;By this doing&rdquo; (says Atkins, referring to the
works of bishop Morton) &ldquo;Wisbeach Fens were made good Sheep
pastures, and the fall of the water at Wisbeach became so great,
that no man would adventure under the bridge, with a boat, but by
veering through, &amp;c.&nbsp; But succeeding ages (he further
observes) neglecting these <a name="page20"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 20</span>good provisions, have thereby lost
the benefit.&rdquo;&nbsp; The blame of this neglect, both Atkins
and Sir Clement Edmunds seem to lay entirely on the total want of
public spirit, or the selfish and sordid disposition of the
people of Wisbeach, who strove at all events to avoid the
expence, alleging that the benefit of cleansing and dyking the
outfall would altogether accrue to the behoof of the upland
country, and therefore that they [the inhabitants of the said
upland country] ought to put their hands to the work, and
contribute towards it in some reasonable measure.&nbsp; The
uplanders, on the other hand, produced divers presentments, some
of them as high as Henry VI, shewing, that they ought not to be
charged; at the same time expressing a willingness to yield a
reasonable aid, when the work was done, if it proved
serviceable.&nbsp; But those of Wisbeach required a previous
contribution, to be expended as the work should proceed.&nbsp;
Their selfishness and perverseness, on these occasions, carried
them, it seems, to very extravagant and ridiculous lengths, to
elude the charge: &ldquo;one while saying, they cared not if
Wisbeach were a dry town; another while by thinking to keep it as
a standing pool; [and again] another while enforcing [or urging]
the making of a Sluice between the town and the sea, that the
tide should not silt up the river, saying that otherwise the
charge of dyking the river would be but cast away.&mdash;And to
the charge of this Sluice they would call in the high-country
people, such as they knew would not easily be brought to it, so
that nothing might be done.&rdquo;&nbsp; This preposterous
conduct of the Wisbeachers appears to have effectually frustrated
every reasonable and salutary proposal.&nbsp; Atkins, however,
gives it <a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
21</span>as his firm opinion, &ldquo;that were there in the Isle
of Ely again another bishop <i>Morton</i> the country might well
be regained by such means as might be easily set down.&rdquo; <a
name="citation21a"></a><a href="#footnote21a"
class="citation">[21a]</a>&nbsp; But it does not appear <i>that
another bishop</i> Morton has yet risen in the Isle, whatever may
be said of the regeneration, reformation, or amendment of the
good people of Wisbeach.</p>
<p>Nothing of any consequence appears to have been attempted
since, for the benefit of the port or navigation of Wisbeach,
except <i>Kinderley&rsquo;s Cut</i>, made in 1721 and 1722, by
order of the Board of Adventurers, and not without the consent of
the town of Wisbeach likewise; only the adventurers [it seems]
ought to have had their consent under their hands: at least so
says Mr Kinderly.&nbsp; This cut, had it gone forward, would
probably have been of great advantage to the river.&nbsp; But by
the time that it was completed, and a dam was making across the
old channel, to turn the river into the new one, &ldquo;the
Wisbeach gentlemen, falsely, <i>or by mistake</i>, apprehending
the advantage of a wide indraught over all those spreading sands,
and complaining that this new cut was not wide enough, (though it
was wider than the river at Wisbeach by twenty feet) and that
therefore their river would immediately be choked up, and their
navigation lost.&nbsp; [So they now] violently opposed it, and
raised the Country for demolishing the works; and after that
obtained an injunction from the Lord Chancellor to stop all
further progress.&rdquo; <a name="citation21b"></a><a
href="#footnote21b" class="citation">[21b]</a>&nbsp; A long
vexatious Law Suit ensued, but the <a name="page22"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 22</span>Adventures could not recover the
Money they had laid out, amounting to nearly &pound;2000, and the
gentlemen of Wisbeach gave ample proof that they still inherited,
in full measure, the genuine spirit of their ancestors, before
mentioned.&nbsp; Their Harbour has been for some years in a most
miserable state, and seems to stand in need of the aid of a
<i>Morton</i> or a <i>Kinderly</i> as much as ever.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Section</span> IV.</h4>
<p class="gutsumm"><i>The Effects on Lynn</i>, <i>and on its
Harbour and Navigation</i>, <i>of the great accession of Fresh
Waters in the reign of Henry</i> III.</p>
<p>Let us now attend to the Ouse and its sister streams, in their
now or modern course, by Denver, Downham, St. German&rsquo;s, and
Lynn.&nbsp; By the addition of so many large rivers to its former
waters, Lynn might be expected to have its Haven, by degrees,
both widened and deepened, so as to contribute materially to its
future naval consequence, and commercial importance.&nbsp;
Previously to this great accession of water, the bed or channel
of the river, about St. German&rsquo;s, has been represented as
so very narrow, that in some places a man might throw himself
over with a pikestaff; and in Lynn Haven it is said to have been
but six poles, or about an hundred feet wide.&nbsp; But
afterward, by the said accession of fresh waters, Lynn Haven and
channel were made in time so wide and deep as to become famous
for Navigation. <a name="citation22"></a><a href="#footnote22"
class="citation">[22]</a></p>
<p><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>Things
appear to have continued pretty much in this favourable state,
till sometime after the erection of the Sluices at Denver; which
by preventing the tides from going further up into the country,
as before, proved very prejudicial to the harbour and Navigation
of Lynn; and the effects are felt, it seems, and much complained
of to this day.&nbsp; The free admission of the tides, and the
natural course of the freshes are said to have kept other rivers
open and navigable; and this appears to have been the case with
the Ouse itself, while it possessed those advantages, or till the
adventurers erected the said sluices across its channel, which
are thought to have proved so very prejudicial, not only to the
navigation of Lynn, Cambridge, &amp;c. but even to the draining
of the Fen districts and Marshland.</p>
<p>Before the erection of those sluices, the tide is said to have
gone up the rivers a very great way.&nbsp; Into the Ouse, and
Grant, or Cam, it went, according to <i>Badeslade</i>, five miles
above their junction, or 48 above Lynn; into the Larke, or
Mildenhall river, eight miles above its month, or 42 above Lynn;
into the lesser Ouse, or Brandon river, ten miles above its
mouth, or 36 above Lynn; into the Wessey, or Stoke river, six
miles above its mouth, or 24 above Lynn; and into the Nene, <a
name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>seven miles
above its mouth, or 23 above Lynn. <a name="citation24a"></a><a
href="#footnote24a" class="citation">[24a]</a>&mdash;These rivers
are said to be then completely supplied with water from the sea,
in the driest seasons, to serve for inland navigation.&mdash;The
Nene, to Well, Marsh, and Peterborough, &amp;c. with vessels of
15 tuns in the driest times: the Ouse, with vessels of 40 tuns,
36 miles, at least, from Lynn, in ordinary neap tides; and to
Huntingdon, St. Neots, Bedford, and even as far as 90 miles from
Lynn, with vessels of 15 tuns.&nbsp; The tides then raised the
waters at Salters Lode 12 feet above low-water mark.&nbsp; These
waters in their return scoured the channel, and kept it clear and
deep.&nbsp; This seems to have been the case before the erection
of the sluices; but whether it would have continued so to this
time, may, perhaps, be doubted.&nbsp; Badeslade and Kinderly seem
to have entertained different and opposite opinions on the
subject; as the reader may see by consulting their respective
publications.</p>
<p>In a course of time, Lynn Haven is said to wear from 6 or 8 to
40 poles wide; which seems not improbable, considering the
situation of it, and the accession of so many large rivers.&nbsp;
In Badeslade&rsquo;s time, as he says, <a
name="citation24b"></a><a href="#footnote24b"
class="citation">[24b]</a> it was from 50 to 60 poles in the
narrowest part; and <a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span>now it can be no less.&nbsp; The Lynn river, however,
has been thought to be still narrower than any other of equal
size so near its outfall.&nbsp; Before the erection of the said
Dams, or Sluices no complaints appear to have been made of either
the haven, or yet the rivers above wanting a competent depth of
water.&nbsp; Barges carrying 40 chalders could then go up the
Ouse 36 miles, and those that carried from 26 to 30 chalders
passed with ease to the very town of Cambridge.&nbsp; Whereas, in
Badeslade&rsquo;s time, flat bottom lighters, with eight or ten
chalders, could hardly pass.&nbsp; Nor does it appear that things
have gotten to a better state since.&nbsp; As to the haven, or
harbour of Lynn, it was at those times wide, deep, and
commodious.&nbsp; In 1645 its breadth is said to have been about
a furlong.&nbsp; Ships then, and for some years after, rode at
the south end of the town, and the west side in two fathoms, at
low water.&nbsp; So they also did at the Crutch; and the largest
ships could go to sea at neap tides.&nbsp; Two parts of the
harbour were then remarkably deep; the one called
<i>Fieln&rsquo;s Road</i>, at the end of the west channel; and
the other <i>Ferrier&rsquo;s Road</i>, at the end of the east
channel; and both of them three and half fathoms at low
water.&nbsp; The tides too were then so strong as to make it
necessary to use stream cables to moor the ships.&nbsp; <i>Guybon
Goddard</i>, Esq. a former Recorder of Lynn (and brother in law
to Sir Wm. Dugdale) who died about 1677, says, that at the
World&rsquo;s End in the Harbour of Lynn, there was not in any
man&rsquo;s remembrance less than ten or eleven feet at low
water; and at a place called the <i>Mayor&rsquo;s Fleet</i> 8 or
9 feet.&nbsp; The channel <a name="page26"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 26</span>to seaward, below the haven, he says,
near half mile wide at low water, was yet of a depth sufficient
for a Ship of 12 foot water to be brought up in any one tide
without wind. <a name="citation26a"></a><a href="#footnote26a"
class="citation">[26a]</a>&nbsp; Upon the whole, it appears that
the state of Lynn Harbour, and of the rivers which discharge
themselves that way, was before the erection of the Sluices much
superior to what it has been since. <a name="citation26b"></a><a
href="#footnote26b" class="citation">[26b]</a></p>
<p>As to the State of the Ouse and the other rivers up in the
country above Lynn, it seems to have been much better before the
undertaking for a general drainage and erection of the Sluices
than since that period, as appears from the views of the Sewers
taken June 25, 1605, by Sir Robert Bevill, Sir John Peyton,
&amp;c. at Salters Lode, where the Nene falls into the
Ouse.&nbsp; The commissioners declared the fall from the soil of
the Fens to low watermark as no less than ten feet, beside the
natural descent of the grounds from the uplands of
Huntingdonshire thither; which shews the bottom of the Ouse to be
there much deeper then than it was afterward.&nbsp;
<i>Dugdale</i> also, in his History of Embanking, says, that at
Salter&rsquo;s Lode there was ten feet fall of the fens at low
water mark.&nbsp; <a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
27</span>From these statements it must necessarily follow, that
the lands in the South Level, though unembanked, must in general
have been in a comparatively good condition before the
undertaking for a general drainage and erection of the Sluices;
for, the fall being so great, no water could lie long upon them;
and if at any time, by the descent of the upland waters, they
became overflowed, they would not long continue in that
state.&nbsp; At present, the case, it seems, is very
different.</p>

<p class="gutsumm"><i>Of the Eabrink Cut</i>, <i>and other
projects of former times&mdash;with some slight hints on the
comparative state of the Shipping&mdash;Commercial consequence
and population of Lynn at different periods</i>.</p>
<p>It seems allowed on all hands that Lynn Harbour has grown much
worse in the memory of the present inhabitants, and that it is
daily getting more and more so.&nbsp; To remedy this growing and
alarming evil, as well as to promote and facilitate the inland
navigation and drainage of the Fen Districts, a project was
formed some few years ago to open a straight cut from Eabrink,
about three miles above the town, into the upper part of the said
harbour, with the view of scouring, deepening, and improving the
same; and an Act of Parliament was obtained for that
purpose.&nbsp; The work however, has been hitherto postponed: it
being, it seems, found difficult to raise a fund adequate to the
occasion.&nbsp; Vast benefits are <a name="page28"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 28</span>said to be confidently expected by
many from the execution of this project; while others appear much
less sanguine in their expectations, and even consider it as in
no small degree dubious and problematical.</p>
<p>The opening a straight cut from Eabrink to Lynn Haven is not
indeed, properly speaking, a new or a late project.&nbsp; It was
suggested and recommended many years ago, as a part of a far more
extensive undertaking, by Mr <i>Kinderley</i>, who wrote a large
pamphlet on the subject, the second and last edition of which was
published in 1751.&mdash;His favourite scheme was to continue the
Cut from Lynn, through the marshes below the <i>Wottons</i>,
<i>Babingley</i> and <i>Wolverton</i>, into what is called the
<i>Old Road</i>; and to bring the Wisbeach river from the mouth
of the <i>Shiredam</i> across Marshland into Lynn Harbour.&nbsp;
The Welland also or Spalding river, he proposed to conduct by
another cut to Boston, there to join the Witham, and pass along
with it to the sea by a new outlet, so that there might be but
<i>two outlets</i> instead of <i>four</i>, for all the great Fen
rivers.&nbsp; The accomplishment of this vast plan, as he
imagined, would not fail of being productive of many and most
important benefits:&mdash;The harbours of Lynn and Boston, of
course, would become more accessible, and be otherwise greatly
improved:&mdash;The two washes would inevitably and soon be
filled up, by the abundance of silt and mud which the tides would
lodge there, and which would shortly be converted into firm and
fertile land.&mdash;Also an extensive district larger than all
Marshland, and almost as large as the whole county of
<i>Rutland</i>, and of far <a name="page29"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 29</span>greater value, would in no very long
time be gained from the sea, and brought into a condition to be
effectually secured by embankments from any future annoyance from
the briny element.&mdash;Moreover, a good turnpike road, straight
as an arrow, might and would be made across this recovered
country, all the way from Lynn to Boston, to the no small
convenience and comfort of travellers, (as the obstructions and
dangers of the <i>Washes</i> would no longer exist) and to the
facilitating and perpetuating a safe and easy intercourse between
the inhabitants of Lincolnshire, as well as of all the north of
England and those of Norfolk, Suffolk and the whole eastern coast
of the Kingdom.&nbsp; The scheme or project, however, was not
adopted, nor perhaps ever sufficiently attended to; and it may
not now be worth while to inquire into the cause of its
miscarriage or rejection.&nbsp; Whether this same scheme shall
hereafter be ever adopted, executed, or realized, no mortal at
present is capable of divining.</p>
<p>Between Mr Kinderley and Mr Badeslade there seems to have
existed a considerable difference of opinion on some
points.&nbsp; The former ascribed the increasing foulness and
decay of Lynn Harbour to the increasing width of the channel
below, the loose and light nature of the sand there, subject to
the powerful action of the tides, continually driving up those
sands and lodging them in the harbour and river above: whereas
the latter seems to ascribe it chiefly, if not solely to the
Sluices, or the obstruction which they occasioned to the free
influx and <a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
30</span>efflux of the waters. <a name="citation30a"></a><a
href="#footnote30a" class="citation">[30a]</a>&nbsp; Each writer
supports his own opinion with great confidence; but the question
remains undecided.&nbsp; Both of them, perhaps, might be right in
many or most of their ideas and reasonings.</p>
<p>Very unlike most other great Sea-port towns, whose shipping
and trade have vastly increased within the last hundred years,
Lynn appears to have remained, in a great measure,
stationary.&nbsp; As long ago as 1654 we hear of <i>fourscore</i>
vessels or more belonging to the port of Lynn, (some of them
drawing 13 or 14 feet water) and that they used then to make from
15 to 18 Voyages annually to Newcastle, for coals, Salt,
&amp;c.&nbsp; Also that Ship-building was at that period very
briskly carried on in the town, to keep up the stock.&nbsp;
Moreover the number of seamen and watermen, then employed here,
is said to amount to, at least, fifteen hundred; and the whole
number of inhabitants was probably equal to that of any
subsequent period.&nbsp; It seems, indeed, to be now the
prevailing opinion, that the present population of Lynn exceeds
that of any former time; which yet may be deemed somewhat
doubtful, if not quite improbable; especially as it is known to
have been formerly a <i>manufacturing</i> town, <a
name="citation30b"></a><a href="#footnote30b"
class="citation">[30b]</a> which is not its case at
present.&nbsp; The <a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
31</span>point, however, may not now be very easy to
determine.&nbsp; But it seems very evident, that the trade of
Lynn has not increased to the degree or extent that might have
been expected, from the great opulence of its merchants and the
vast extent of its inland navigation.&nbsp; The real or probable
cause of this will not become here the subject of enquiry; but it
may not be unworthy of investigation.</p>

Fen Country.&mdash;View of their situation and revolutions in

<p class="gutsumm"><i>Account of their state before and after the
arrival of the Romans&mdash;Character of that
people&mdash;establishment of their power here&mdash;improvements
made by them in these parts</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">As</span> Lynn may be considered as the
Capital or Metropolis of Marshland and the Fens, it will not be
improper to give here some account of those remarkable districts
from the earliest times.&nbsp; All this flat and level country is
thought to have been originally a vast forest, which was
afterwards in some measure cleared, and converted into good
cultivated land, fertile fields, rich pastures, and numerous
habitations of industrious men.&nbsp; After that however, it was,
it seems, for no short period, covered by the sea, occasioned,
perhaps, by an earthquake, or some such convulsive event, which
might considerably lower or sink the whole surface of the
country, and so make way for the violent influx of the
ocean.&nbsp; The overflowing waters in time gradually covering
the original surface of the ground with silt and sand to a very
<a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>great
depth, or rather height, would at last recede.&nbsp; The present
face of the country, composed of silt to a vast depth,(and which
seems no other than marine sediment) confirms this
hypothesis.&nbsp; Still however the parts next the sea, such as
Marshland and the low-lands on the eastern side of Lincolnshire
would remain as a great salt marsh, occasionally overflowed,
especially at spring-tides.&mdash;This seems to have been the
case when <i>Julius C&aelig;sar</i> invaded this country, and
when <i>Claudius</i> afterwards reduced it to the state of a
Roman Province.</p>
<p>The Romans, with all their faults, were certainly a wonderful
people.&nbsp; Like all other invaders and conquerors they were in
general very hard masters, and in some respects most vile
oppressors and tyrants.&nbsp; In other respects, however, they
may be said to have been eventually real benefactors to many, if
not to most of the countries and nations which they subdued, as
they were the means of greatly improving those countries, and of
introducing among their inhabitants the rudiments of useful
knowledge, habits of industry, and the laws of civilization.</p>
<p>Julius C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s invasion of Britain seems to have
proved upon the whole unsuccessful; for he withdrew to the
continent, without being able to effect its subjugation, or to
retain the conquests which he is supposed to have made; which may
be thought to furnish a pretty strong argument in favour of the
independent spirit, and high military character of the British
nation at that time.&nbsp; Nor does it appear that the Romans
ever attempted to give <a name="page34"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 34</span>our ancestors any further disturbance
afterward, till the reign of Claudius, whose general, <i>Aulus
Plautius</i>, a person of senatorial dignity, was the first that
established the power of that people, or gave them a firm footing
in this island.&nbsp; This was near a hundred years after the
retreat or departure of Julius C&aelig;sar; and the success of
Plautius is said to have been chiefly or greatly owing to the
bitter dissentions which then raged among the British chieftains,
some of whom had invited the Romans hither, and afterward joined
them against their own country-men.&nbsp; Claudius himself came
over sometime after, and completed the conquest of a great part
of South Britain, including, it seems, the country of the
<i>Iceni</i>, which comprehended the present counties of Norfolk
and Suffolk, with most, if not the whole of those of Cambridge
and Huntingdon, and probably some part of Lincolnshire.&nbsp; So
that the parts adjoining the Fens became subject to the Romans
among their earliest acquisitions in Britain.&nbsp; The
inhabitants of these parts are also said to have made the least
resistance to them, at first, of any of the British States, and
therefore to have been for sometime more highly favoured by them
than any of the rest.&nbsp; Claudius at his departure from this
island, which is said to have been in the year 43 of the
Christian Era, left here a considerable force under Plautius,
Vespasian (afterwards emperor) and other experienced and able
Generals, who were succeeded by others, no way their inferiors,
in experience, ability, or military fame; among whom were
Ostorius Scapula, Suetonius Paulinus, and Julius Agricola.&nbsp;
Besides Julius C&aelig;sar, Claudius, and Vespasian, several
others of the Roman <a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
35</span>emperors are said to have spent some part of their time
in this island; and particular Hadrian, Severus, Constantius
Chlorus, and his son Constantine the Great.&nbsp; The latter is
supposed to have been born here, and his mother is said to have
been a Briton.&nbsp; His father, as well as his predecessor
Severus, died at York, a place of no small consequence and
celebrity in those times.</p>
<p>After the country was reduced, and made a part or province of
the empire, the Romans soon began to view it as a very important
acquisition.&nbsp; Accordingly they set in good earnest about
improving it; and there are still to be seen numerous proofs and
monuments of their laborious, ingenious, and successful
exertions.&nbsp; Among their important improvements here were
included the draining of the Fens, and the embanking of the
Marshes, to secure them against the violence and destructive
inroads of the ocean.&nbsp; Marshland and the low lands of
Lincolnshire, as was before observed, they found in the miserable
condition of a salt marsh, occasionally and frequently overflowed
by the tides.&nbsp; This country they secured by very strong and
extensive embankments, which bear their name to this day. <a
name="citation35a"></a><a href="#footnote35a"
class="citation">[35a]</a></p>
<p>These improvements in the Fens and Marshes are said to have
been the works of a colony of foreigners, <a
name="citation35b"></a><a href="#footnote35b"
class="citation">[35b]</a> brought over, probably, from Belgium,
a country of a similar description, whose natives, from their
previous knowledge and habits, would be eminently fitted for <a
name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>such
employments.&nbsp; Not that those works can be supposed to have
been effected without the powerful co-operation of the native
Britons, who would sometimes loudly complain of the hardships
they endured in labours of this kind, imposed upon them by the
Romans: a plain proof that they bore their full share of
them.&nbsp; <i>Catus Decianus</i>, it seems, was the name of the
Roman officer who had the chief direction or superintendence of
the improvements then projected and carried on in the Fens. <a
name="citation36"></a><a href="#footnote36"
class="citation">[36]</a>&nbsp; He was probably the first Roman
Procurator of the province of the Iceni, and continued to be so
for many years.&nbsp; Some things recorded of him, during his
government here exhibit him in a very unamiable and detestable
light; and it may be presumed that he was an unfeeling and severe
task-master to the workmen whom he employed in the fens and
marshes, as well as elsewhere; so that we need not wonder that
they should sometimes loudly complain of the hardships they
underwent.&nbsp; The public works of which he had the direction
and superintendence seem, however, to have been carried on by him
with no small energy and effect, and to have been soon brought to
a state of considerable forwardness and perfection.</p>
<p>The Fens must have been in a very dismal state before the
arrival of the Romans; and their exertions, undoubtedly, wrought
a mighty, and most happy change in the face of the country.&nbsp;
Houses, villages, and towns would now appear in places that were
before perfectly desolate and dreary.&nbsp; At this period we may
venture to <a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
37</span>date the origin of Lynn; for it may be pretty safely
concluded that it owes its rise to the schemes formed by the
Romans for the recovery and improvement of these fens and
marshes.&nbsp; It is also very probable, not only that it was the
first town built in these parts, on that occasion, but also that
it was built and inhabited by those foreign colonists above
mentioned, and derived its name from them.&nbsp; This however is
not the proper place for the further elucidation of this point:
our present business being with the history of the Fens.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Section</span> II.</h4>
<p class="gutsumm"><i>Further strictures on the ancient state of
this country</i>, <i>and on a wonderful change it appears to have
undergone</i>, <i>at a very remote and unknown period</i>;
<i>from De Serra&rsquo;s account of a submarine Forest on the
coast of Lincolnshire</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Some</span> very remote ages ago, the
land, it seems, extended much further out on the Lincolnshire
coast than it does at present; and it appears that whole forests
once existed in places now wholly occupied by the ocean; which
must tend to corroborate what has been already suggested, that
the whole face of the fens was originally a forest.&nbsp; A
remarkable Paper, giving an account of a <i>Submarine Forest</i>
on the said coast, appeared in the Philosophical Transactions for
1799.&nbsp; Part I. written by Joseph Correa De Serra
L.L.D.&nbsp; F.R.S. and A.S. in which the Author informs us of a
report in Lincolnshire, that a large extent of islets of moor, <a
name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>situated
along the coast, and visible only in the lowest ebbs of the year,
was chiefly composed of decayed trees.&nbsp; That report induced
him to take a journey thither for the purpose of inspecting so
singular a curiosity.&nbsp; Those islets, he observes, are marked
in <i>Mitchell&rsquo;s Chart</i> of that coast by the name of
<i>Clay huts</i>; and the Village of <i>Huttoft</i>, opposite to
which they principally lie, he supposes to have derived its name
from them.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In the Month of September 1796, (says he) I
went to Sutton, on the coast of Lincolnshire, in the company of
the right honourable the President of the Royal Society, in order
to examine their nature and extent.&nbsp; The 19th of the month
being the day after the equinoctial full moon, when the lowest
ebbs were to be expected, we went in a boat, about half past
twelve at noon, and soon set foot on one of the largest islands
then appearing.&nbsp; Its exposed surface was about 30 yards
long, and 25 wide when the tide was at the lowest.&nbsp; A great
number of smaller islets were visible around us to the eastward
and southward; and the fishermen whose authority in this point is
very competent, say that similar moors are to be found along the
whole coast from Skegness to Grimsby, particularly off
Addlethorpe and Mablethorpe.&nbsp; The channels dividing the
islets were, at the time we saw them, wide and of various depths;
the islets themselves ranging generally from east to west in
their largest dimensions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We visited them again in the ebbs of the 20th and
21st.; and though it did not generally ebb so far as we expected,
we could notwithstanding ascertain that they consisted almost
entirely of roots, trunks, branches, and <a
name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>leaves of
trees and shrubs, intermixed with some leaves of aquatic
plants.&nbsp; The remains of some of these trees were still
standing on their roots, while the trunks of the greater part lay
scattered on the ground in every possible direction.&nbsp; The
barks of trees and roots appeared generally as fresh as when they
were growing; in that of the branches particularly, of which a
great quantity was found, even the thin silver membranes of outer
skin were discernible.&nbsp; The timber of all kinds on the
contrary, was decomposed, and soft in the greatest part of the
trees: in some, however, it was firm, especially in the
roots.&nbsp; The people of the country have often found among
them very sound pieces of timber, fit to be employed for several
economical purposes.&nbsp; The sorts of wood which are still
distinguishable are, birch, fir, and oak.&nbsp; Other woods
evidently exist in these islets, of some of which we found the
leaves in the soil; but our present knowledge of the comparative
anatomy of timber is not so far advanced as to afford us the
means of pronouncing with confidence respecting their
species.&nbsp; In general the trunks, branches, and roots of the
decayed trees were considerably flattened, which is a phenomenon
observed in the <i>Surtarbrand</i>, or fossil wood of Iceland,
and which Scheuchzer remarked also in the fossil wood found in
the neighbourhood of the lake Thun in Switzerland.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The soil to which the trees are fixed, and in which
they grew, is a soft greasy clay; but for many inches above the
surface, the soil is composed of rotten leaves, scarcely
distinguishable to the eye, many of which may <a
name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>be separated
by putting the soil in water and dexterously and patiently using
the Spatula, or blunt knife.&nbsp; By this method I obtained some
imperfect leaves of the <i>Ilexaquifolium</i>, which are now in
the Herbarium of the right honourable Sir Joseph Banks; and some
other leaves, though less perfect, seem to belong to some species
of willow.&nbsp; In this stratum of rotten leaves we could also
distinguish some roots of <i>Arundo Phragmites</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These islets, according to the most accurate
information, extend at least twelve miles in length, and about a
mile in breadth, opposite to Sutton shore.&nbsp; The water
without them toward the sea, generally deepens suddenly, so as to
form a steep bank.&nbsp; The channels between the several islets,
when the islets are dry, in the lowest ebbs of the year, are from
four to twelve feet deep: their bottoms are clay or sand, and
their direction is generally from east to west.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A well, dug at Sutton by Joshua Searby, shews that a
moor of the same nature is found under ground in that part of the
country, at the depth of sixteen feet, consequently very nearly
on the same level with that which constitutes the islets.&nbsp;
The disposition of the strata was found to be nearly as follows:
clay sixteen feet; moor, similar to that of the islets, three or
four ditto; soft moor, like the scourings of a ditch bottom,
mixed with shells and silt, twenty feet; marly clay, one foot;
chalky rock, from one to two feet; clay, thirty-one yards; gravel
and water; the water has a chalybeate taste.&nbsp; In order to
ascertain the course of this subterraneous <a
name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>stratum of
decayed vegetables, Sir Joseph Banks directed a boring to be made
in the fields belonging to the royal Society in the parish of
Mablethorpe.&nbsp; Moor of a similar nature to that of
Searby&rsquo;s well, and the islets, was found very nearly on the
same level, about four feet thick, and under a soft clay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The whole appearance of the rotten vegetables we
observed, perfectly resembles, according to the remark of Sir
Joseph Banks, the moor which, in Blakeney Fen, and in other parts
of the East Fen in Lincolnshire, is thrown up in the making of
banks; barks like those of the birch-tree being there also
abundantly found.&nbsp; The moor extends over all the
Lincolnshire fens, and has been traced as far as Peterborough,
more than sixty miles to the south of Sutton.&nbsp; On the north
side, according to the fishermen, the moory islets extend as far
as Grimsby, situated on the south side of the Humber: and it is a
remarkable circumstance, that in the large tracts of low land
which lie on the south banks of that river, a little above its
mouth, there is a subterraneous stratum of decayed trees and
shrubs, exactly like those we have observed at Sutton;
particularly at Axolme isle, a tract of ten miles in length by
five in breadth; and at Hatfield chace, which comprehends 180,000
acres.&nbsp; Dugdale had long ago made this observation in the
first of these places; and Dela Prime in the second.&nbsp; The
roots are there likewise standing in the places where they grew:
the trunks lie prostrate.&nbsp; The woods are of the same species
as at Sutton.&nbsp; Roots of aquatic plants and reeds <a
name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>are likewise
mixed with them; and they are covered by a stratum of some yards
of soil, the thickness of which, though not ascertained with
exactness by the abovementioned observers, we may easily conceive
to correspond with what covers the stratum of decayed wood at
Sutton, by the circumstances of the roots being (according to Mr.
Richardson&rsquo;s observations) only visible when the water is
low, where a channel was cut which has left them uncovered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little doubt can be entertained of the moory islets of
Sutton being a part of this extensive and subterraneous stratum,
which, by some inroad of the sea, has there been stripped of its
covering of soil.&nbsp; The identity of the levels; that of the
species of trees; the roots of these affixed in both to the soil
where they grew; and above all, the flattened shape of the
trunks, branches, and roots, found in the islets (which can only
be accounted for by the heavy pressure of a superinduced stratum)
are sufficient reasons for this opinion.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="gutsumm"><i>Further observations from the same
Paper&mdash;Epoch of the destruction of the said
Forest&mdash;Agency by which it was effected</i>,
<i>&amp;c.&mdash;Similar appearances eastward along the Norfolk
coast</i>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Such a wide-spread assemblage of vegetable
ruins, lying almost in the same level, and that level generally
under the common mark of low water, must naturally strike the
observer, and give birth to the following questions: <a
name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>1. What is
the epoch of this destruction?&nbsp; 2. By what agency was it
effected?</p>
<p>&ldquo;In answer to these questions I will venture to submit
the following reflections: The fossil remains of vegetables
hitherto dug up in so many parts of the globe, are, on a close
inspection, found to belong to two different states of our
planet.&nbsp; The parts of vegetables and their impressions,
found in mountains, of a colaceous and schistous, or even
sometimes of a calcareous nature, are chiefly of plants now
existing between the tropics, which would neither have grown in
the latitudes in which they are dug up, nor have been carried and
deposited there by any of the acting forces under the present
constitution of nature.&nbsp; The formation indeed of the very
mountains in which they are buried, and the nature and position
of the materials which compose them, are such as we cannot
account for by any actions and re-actions which in the actual
state of things take place on the surface of the earth.&nbsp; We
must necessarily recur to that period in the history of our
planet, when the surface of the ocean was at least so much above
its present level as to cover even the summits of those secondary
mountains which contain the remains of tropical plants.&nbsp; The
changes which these vegetables have suffered in their substance
is almost total; they commonly retain only the external
configuration of what they were.&nbsp; Such is the state in which
they are found in England by Lhwyd; in France by Jussicu; and in
the Netherlands by Burtin; not to mention instances in more
distant countries.&nbsp; Some of the impressions or remains of
plants <a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
44</span>found in soils of this nature which were, by the more
ancient and enlightened oryctologists, supposed to belong to
plants actually growing in temperate and cold climates, seem, on
accurate investigation, to have been part of exotic
vegetables.&nbsp; In fact, whether we suppose them to have grown
near the spot where they are found, or to have been carried
thither from different parts by the force of an impelling flood,
it is equally difficult to conceive how organized beings, which,
in order to live, require such a vast difference in temperature
and seasons, could live on the same spot, or how their remains
could (from climates so widely distant) be brought together in
the place by one common dislocating cause.&nbsp; To this ancient
order of fossil vegetables belong whatever retains a vegetable
shape found in or near coalmines, and (to judge from the places
where they have been found) the greater part of the agatized
woods.&nbsp; But from the species and state of the trees which
are the subject of this memoir, and from the situation and nature
of the soil in which they are found, it seems very clear that
they do not belong to the primeval order of vegetable ruins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The second order of fossil vegetables comprehend those
which are found in the strata of clay or sand; materials which
are the result of slow depositions of the sea and of rivers,
agents still at work under the present constitution of our
planet.&nbsp; These vegetable remains are found in such flat
countries as may be considered to be a new formation.&nbsp; The
vegetable organization still subsists, at least in part; and
their vegetable substance has suffered a change only in colour,
smell, or consistence; alterations <a name="page45"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 45</span>which are produced by the development
of their oily and bitumenous parts, or by their natural progress
towards rottenness.&nbsp; Such are the fossil vegetables found in
Cornwall by Borlase; in Essex, by Derham; in Yorkshire by Dela
Prime and Richardson; and in foreign countries by other
naturalists.&nbsp; These vegetables are found at different
depths; some of them much below the present level of the sea, but
in clayey and sandy strata (evidently belonging to modern
formation); and have, no doubt, been carried from their original
place and deposited there by the force of great rivers or
currents, as it has been observed with respect to the
Mississippi.&nbsp; In many instances, however, these trees and
shrubs are found standing on their roots, and generally in low or
marshy places above, or very little below the level of the
sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To this last description of fossil vegetables the
decayed trees here described certainly belong.&nbsp; They have
not been transported by currents or rivers; but though standing
in their native soil, we cannot suppose the level in which they
are found to be the same as that in which they grew.&nbsp; It
would be impossible for any of these trees or shrubs to vegetate
so near the sea, and below the common level of its water.&nbsp;
The waves would cover such tracts of land, and hinder any
vegetation.&nbsp; We cannot conceive that the surface of the
ocean has ever been any lower than it is now; on the contrary we
are led, by numberless phenomena to believe that the level of the
water in our globe is now below what it was in former
periods.&nbsp; We must therefore conclude, that the forest here
described grew in a level high enough to permit <a
name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>its
vegetation; and that the force (whatever it was) which destroyed
it, lowered the level of the ground where it stood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a force of subsidence (particularly in soft
ground) which being a natural consequence of gravity, slowly,
though imperceptibly operating, has its action sometimes
quickened and rendered sudden by extraneous causes; for instance,
by earthquakes.&nbsp; The slow effects of this force of
subsidence have been accurately remarked in many places: examples
also of its sudden action are recorded in almost every history of
great earthquakes.&mdash;In England, Borlase has given in the
Philosophical Transactions a curious observation of a subsidence
of at least sixteen feet in the ground between Sampson and Trecaw
islands in Scilly.&nbsp; The soft and low grounds between the
towns of Thorne and Gowle in Yorkshire, a space of many miles,
has so much subsided in latter times, that some old men of Thorne
affirmed, &ldquo;that whereas they could before see little of the
Steeples (of Gowle) they now see the church yard
wall.&rdquo;&nbsp; The instances of similar subsidence which
might be mentioned, are innumerable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The force of subsidence, suddenly acting by means of
some earthquake, seems to me the most probable cause to which the
usual submarine situation of the forest we are speaking of may be
ascribed.&nbsp; It affords a simple easy explanation of the
matter; its probability is supported by numberless instances of
similar events; and it is not liable to the strong objections
which exist against the hypothesis of the ultimate depression and
elevation <a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
47</span>of the level of the ocean; an opinion which, to be
credible, requires the support of a great number of proofs less
equivocal than those which have hitherto been urged in its
favour, even by the genius of Lavoisier.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The stratum of soil, sixteen feet thick, placed above
the decayed trees, seems to remove the epoch of their sinking and
destruction far beyond the reach of any historical
knowledge.&nbsp; In C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s time the level of the
north sea appears to have been the same as in our days.&nbsp; He
mentions the separation of the Wahal branch of the Rhine, and its
junction with the Meuse; noticing the then existing distance from
that junction to the sea, which agrees according to
D&rsquo;Anville&rsquo;s inquiries, with the actual
distance.&nbsp; Some of the Roman roads, constructed according to
the order of Augustus, under Agrippa&rsquo;s administration,
leading to the maritime towns of Belgium, still exist, and reach
the present shore.&nbsp; The description which Roman authors have
given of the coast, ports, and mouths of rivers, on both sides of
the North sea, agree in general with their present state; except
in places ravaged by the inroads of this sea, more apt from its
force to destroy the surrounding countries than to increase
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An exact resemblance exists between maritime Flanders
and the opposite coast of England, both in point of elevation
above the sea, and of the internal structure and arrangement of
the soils.&nbsp; On both sides strata of clay, silt, and sand,
(often mixed with decayed vegetables) are found near the surface;
and in both, these <a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
48</span>superior materials cover a very deep stratum of blueish
or dark coloured clay, unmixed with extraneous bodies.&nbsp; On
both sides they are the lowermost part of the soil, existing
between two ridges of high lands, on their respective sides of
the same narrow sea.&nbsp; These two countries are certainly
coeval; and whatever proves that maritime Flanders has been for
many ages out of the sea, must, in my opinion, prove also that
the forest we are speaking of was long before that time destroyed
and buried under a stratum of soil.&nbsp; Now it seems proved
from historical records, carefully collected by several learned
members of the Brussels Academy, that no material change has
happened in the lowermost part of maritime Flanders during the
period of the last two thousand years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am therefore inclined to suppose the original
catastrophe which buried this forest to be of very ancient date;
but I suspect the inroad of the sea which uncovered the decayed
trees of the islands of Sutton, to be comparatively recent.&nbsp;
The state of the leaves and of the timber, and also the tradition
of the neighbouring people concur to strengthen this
suspicion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The reader, it is hoped, will excuse, and even approve the
length of this curious extract, as it seems so well calculated to
account for and elucidate divers striking phenomena in the
natural history of the Fens.</p>
<p>Here it may not be improper further to observe, that the
forest above described seems to have extended from the coast of
Lincolnshire a considerable way along the Norfolk coast; as there
is on the shore, near Thornham <a name="page49"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 49</span>in that county, at low water, the
appearance of a large forest having been, at some period,
interred and swallowed up by the waves.&nbsp; Stools of numerous
large timber trees, and many trunks, are to be seen, but so
rotten, that they may be penetrated by a spade.&nbsp; These lie
in a black mass of vegetable fibres, consisting of decayed
branches, leaves, rushes, flags, &amp;c.&nbsp; The extent of this
once sylvan tract [on the Norfolk coast] must have been great,
from what is discoverable; and at high water, now covered by the
tides, is in one spot from five to six-hundred acres.&nbsp; No
hint of the manner, or the time, in which this submersion
happened, can be traced.&nbsp; Nothing like a bog is near, and
the whole beach besides is composed of a fine ooze, or marine
clay. <a name="citation49"></a><a href="#footnote49"

<p class="gutsumm"><i>Some further geological observations
relating to the Fens</i>, <i>extracted from Dugdale&rsquo;s
Letters to Sir Thomas Browne</i>.</p>
<p>The fullest and most circumstantial account we have of these
Fens is contained in Sir William Dugdale&rsquo;s History of
Embanking, the substance of which will be found in the following
pages.&nbsp; He has also treated upon the same subject in his
correspondence with his friend Sir Thomas Browne, published in
the posthumous works of the latter; some extracts from which,
being much to <a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
50</span>the purpose, shall be here submitted to the
reader&rsquo;s perusal.</p>
<p>In Letter IV, he says to his friend, &ldquo;I shall here
acquaint you with my conceit touching the spacious tract, in form
of a sinus, or bay, which we call the great level of the fens;
extending from Lynn beyond Waynfleet in Lincolnshire in length;
and in breadth into some parts of the counties of Norfolk,
Suffolk, Cambridge, Huntingdon, Northampton, and Lincoln:
intreating your opinion therein.&nbsp; That it was at first firm
land I am induced to believe, when I consider the multitude of
trees (fir, oak, and other kinds) found in those drains and
diggings which have of late years been made there.&rdquo;&nbsp;
After mentioning some instances, he adds&mdash;&ldquo;Mr Goddard,
Recorder of Lynn, assures me that lately in Marshland, about a
mile from Magdalen Bridge, about seventeen feet deep (upon
occasion of letting down a sluice) were found below the silt (for
of that sort is all Marshland and Holland) in very firm earth,
furze bushes, as they grew, not rotted; and nut trees, with nuts,
not perished; neither of which kind of bushes or trees are now
growing upon that silty soil of Marshland, though it be fruitful
and rich for other vegetables.&rdquo;&mdash;Afterward he adds,
&ldquo;I shall tell you how I conclude it became a fen by the
stagnation of the fresh waters; which is thus&mdash;The sea
having its passage upon the ebbs and flows thereof along the
coast of Norfolk to the coast of Lincolnshire, did in time, by
reason of its muddiness, leave a shelf of silt betwixt those two
points of land, viz. Rising in Norfolk, and the country about
Spilsby in Lincolnshire, <a name="page51"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 51</span>which shelf increasing in height and
length so much, as that the ordinary tides did not overflow it,
was by that check of those fluxes, in time, so much augmented in
breadth, that the Romans finding it considerable for the
fertility of the soil, made the first Sea-banks for its
preservation from the Spring-tides, which might otherwise
overflow it.&nbsp; And now, Sir, by this settling of the silt,
the soil of Marshland and Holland had its first beginning.&nbsp;
By the like excess of silt brought into the mouths of these
rivers, which had their outfalls at Lynn, Wisbeach, and Boston,
where the fresh water is so stopped, as that the ordinary land
floods, being not of force enough to grind it out (as the term
is) all the level behind became overflowed; and as an ordinary
pond gathereth mud, so did this do more, which in time hath
increased to such thickness, that since the <i>Po-dike</i> was
made to keep up the fresh water from drowning Marshland on the
other side, and South Eau-Bank for the preservation of Holland
from the like inundation, the level of the Fenn is become four
feet higher than the level of Marshland, as Mr Vermuiden assured
me upon a view and observation thereof.&rdquo;&mdash;Afterward he
observes, &ldquo;That the time when the passage of Wisbeach was
so silted up, as that the outfall of the great river Ouse, which
was there, became altered, and was diverted to Lynn, was in Henry
the third&rsquo;s reign, as my testimonies (says he) from records
manifest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In his 5th Letter he says to his friend&mdash;&ldquo;Since I
wrote to you for your opinion touching the various course <a
name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>of the sea, I
met with some notable instances of that kind in a late author,
viz. <i>Olivarius Uredius</i>, in his History of Flanders; which
he manifesteth to be occasioned from
<i>Earthquakes</i>.&rdquo;&mdash;And this appears to have become
afterward our author&rsquo;s own settled opinion, as to the
ancient influx of the sea over this great level country.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Section</span> V.</h4>
<p class="gutsumm"><i>A concise view of the ancient and modern
history of the Fen Country</i>, <i>from Pennant&rsquo;s Preface
to his third volume of Arctic Zoology</i>.</p>
<p>Among the modern authors who have treated of these Fens, no
one, perhaps, ranks higher than Pennant.&nbsp; Of this singular
tract of country he gives the following account.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The great Level, which comprehends Holland
in this county, [Lincolnshire] with part of Northamptonshire,
Huntingdonshire, Cambridgeshire, Suffolk and Norfolk, a tract of
sixty computed miles in length, and forty in breadth, had been
originally a wooded country.&nbsp; Whole forests of firs and oaks
have been found in digging, far beneath the moor on the solid
ground; oaks fifteen feet in girth, and ten yards long, mostly
burnt at the bottoms, the ancient method of falling them:
multitudes of others entirely rooted up, as appears, by the force
of the sea bursting in and overwhelming this whole tract, and
covering it with silt, or mud which it carried with it from time
to time.</p>
<p><a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
53</span>&ldquo;In process of time, this tract underwent another
revolution.&nbsp; The silt or mud gained so considerably as to
leave vast spaces dry, and other parts so shallow, as to
encourage the Romans to gain these fertilised countries from the
sea.&nbsp; Those sensible and indefatigable people first taught
us the art of embanking, and recovered the valuable lands we now
possess.&nbsp; It was the complaint of <i>Galgacus</i>, that they
exhausted the strength of the Britons, <i>in sylvis et paludibus
emuniendis</i>, <a name="citation53a"></a><a href="#footnote53a"
class="citation">[53a]</a> in clearing woods and draining
marshes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After the Romans deserted our island, another change
took place.&nbsp; Neglect of their labours succeeded: the drains
were no longer kept open, and the whole became fen and shallow
lake, resembling the present east fen; the haunt of myriads of
water fowl, or the retreat of banditti.&nbsp; Ely and many little
tracts, which had the advantage of elevation, were at that period
literally islands.&nbsp; Several of these in early times, became
the retreat of the religious.&nbsp; Ely, Thorney, Ramsey, Spiney
and others rose into celebrated Abbeys, and by the industry of
their inhabitants first began to restore the works of the
Romans.&nbsp; The country above Thorney, is represented by an old
historian [<i>William of Malmsbury</i>] as a paradise.&nbsp;
Constant visitations, founded on wholesome laws, preserved this
vast recovered country; but on the rapid and rapacious
dissolution, the removal of several of the inhabitants, and the
neglect of the laws of <i>sewers</i>, the drains were filled, the
cultivated lands overflowed, and the country, again reduced to a
useless morass.&rdquo; <a name="citation53b"></a><a
href="#footnote53b" class="citation">[53b]</a></p>
<p><a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>In the
20th. of Elizabeth, the state of the country was taken into
consideration: <a name="citation54"></a><a href="#footnote54"
class="citation">[54]</a> no great matters were done till the
time of Francis, and William his son, earls of Bedford, who
attempted this Herculean work, and reclaimed this vast tract of
more than 300,000 acres; and the last received, under the
sanction of Parliament, the just reward of 90,000 acres.&nbsp; I
speak not of the reliques of ancient banks, which I have seen in
Holland in Lincolnshire, now remote from the sea, nor yet the
Roman timuli, the coins and other evidences of the residence of
that nation in these parts: it is to be hoped that will be
undertaken by the pen of some native, who will perform it from
actual survey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The vast fenny tracts of these countries were in old
times the haunts of multitudes of water fowl, but the happy
change, by attention to draining, has substituted in their place
thousands of sheep; or, instead of reeds, made those tracts laugh
with corn.&nbsp; The <i>Crane</i>, which once abounded in these
parts, has even deserted our island.&nbsp; The common <i>wild
duck</i> still breeds in multitudes in the unreclaimed parts; and
thousands are sent annually to the London markets, from the
numerous <i>Decoys</i>.&nbsp; The <i>Greylag Goose</i>, the
origin of the tame, breeds here, and is resident the whole
year.&nbsp; A few others of the duck kind breed here.&nbsp;
<i>Lapwings</i>, <i>Red-breasted Godwits</i>, and
<i>Whimbrels</i> are found here during summer; but with their
young in autumn disperse about the island.&nbsp; The
<i>Short-eared Owl</i> migrates here with the <i>Woodcock</i>,
and is a welcome guest to the farmer, by <a
name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>clearing the
fields of mice.&nbsp; <i>Knots</i> swarm on the coast in winter:
are taken in numbers in nets: yet none are seen during
summer.&nbsp; The most distant north is probably the retreat of
the multitude of water-fowl of each order which stock our shores,
driven southward by the extreme cold: most of them regularly,
others whose nature enables them to brave the usual winters of
the frigid zone, are with us only accidental guests, and in
seasons when the frost rages in their native land with unusual
severity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the latitude of Boston, or about latitude 53, the
following remark may be made on the vegetable creation: a line
may be drawn to the opposite part of the kingdom, which will
comprehend the greatest part of Lincolnshire, Nottinghamshire,
Derbyshire, the moorlands of Staffordshire, all Cheshire,
Flintshire, Denbighshire, Caernarvonshire, and Anglesey.&nbsp;
Beyond this line, nature hath allotted to the northern parts of
these kingdoms certain plants which are rarely or never found to
transgress that line to the south.&rdquo;&mdash;In another place
he says,</p>
<p>&ldquo;From Hulm, the northern promontory of Norfolk, the sea
advances deeply westward, and forms the great bay called <i>The
Washes</i>, filled with vast sand banks, the summits of which are
dry at low water; but the intervening channels are the means of
prodigious commerce to Lynn, seated on the Ouse, which is
circulated into the very inland parts of our Island, through the
various rivers which fall into its long course.&nbsp; Lynn is
mentioned in the <i>Domesday book</i>, but became considerable <a
name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>for its
commerce with Norway, as early as the year 1284.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The opposite shore is that of Lincolnshire.&nbsp; Its
great commercial town Boston stands on the Witham, a few miles
from the head of the bay.&nbsp; Spring tides rise at the Key
fourteen-feet, and convey there vessels of above a hundred tons;
but greater ships lie at the scap, the opening of the
Estuary.&mdash;The sluggish rivers of these tame tracts want
force to form a depth of Water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lincolnshire and part of six other counties are the
<i>pais bas</i>, the <i>Low countries</i> [or <i>Netherlands</i>]
of Britain.&nbsp; This very extensive tract, from the scap to the
northern head land, opposite to Hull, presents to the Sea a
bowlike and almost unindented front; and so low as to be visible
from sea only at a small distance, and churches instead of hills
are the only land-marks to seamen, among which the beautiful
Steeple of Boston is particularly distinguished.&nbsp; The whole
Coast is pointed with Salt-marshes or sand hills, and secured by
artificial banks.&nbsp; Old <i>Hollingshed</i> gives a long list
of ports on this now inhospitable coast.&nbsp; <i>Waynfleet</i>,
once a noted haven, is at present a mere creek.&nbsp;
<i>Skegness</i>, once a large walled town with a good harbour, is
now an inconsiderable place, a mile from the sea: and the port of
<i>Grimsby</i>, which in the time of Edward III. furnished him
with eleven ships, is now totally choked with sand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All these coasts of Lincolnshire are flat, and have
been gained from the sea.&nbsp; <i>Barton</i> and <i>Barrow</i>
have not <a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
57</span>at present the least appearance of ports; and yet by
Hollingshed were styled good ones.&nbsp; Similar accidents have
befallen the low tract of Holderness, which faces the congruent
shores.&nbsp; <i>Hedon</i>, a few miles below Hull, several
hundred years ago a port of great commerce, is now a mile and
half from the water, and has long given way to the fortune of the
latter (a creation of Edward I in 1296) on account of the
excellency of its port.&nbsp; But in return the sea has made
ample reprisals on the lands of this Hundred.&nbsp; The site, and
even the very names of several places, once towns of note upon
the <i>Humber</i>, are now only recorded in history; and
<i>Ravenspur</i> was at one time the rival of Hull, and a port so
very considerable in 1332, that Edward Baliol and the
confederated English barons sailed from hence with a great fleet
to invade Scotland: Henry IV, in 1399 made choice of this port to
land at, to effect the deposal of Richard II; yet the whole of it
has been long since devoured by the merciless ocean; extensive
sands, dry at low water, are to be seen in their stead: except
<i>Sunk Island</i>, which till about 1666 appeared among them
like an elevated shoal, at which period it was regained, by
embankments from the sea, and now forms a considerable estate,
probably restored to its pristine condition.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="gutsumm"><i>Further account of the Fens</i>, <i>from
the</i> <span class="smcap">Beauties of England</span>, <i>and
other sources</i>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;That this vast level was at first a firm
dry land, and not annoyed with any extraordinary inundation by
the sea, or stagnation of fresh waters, is evident from the
quantity of trees that have been found buried in different parts
of the fens, and also from a variety of other circumstances.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dugdale, in his <i>History of Embanking</i>, observes
that in making several-channels for draining in the isle of
Axholm, great numbers of oak, fir, and other trees were found in
the moor.&nbsp; The fir trees lay at the depth of between four
and five feet, but the oaks were but little more than three feet
beneath the soil.&nbsp; They were discovered lying near their
roots, which &ldquo;still stand as they grew,&rdquo; that is, in
firm earth below the moor, and the bodies, for the most part,
northwest from the roots, not cut down with axes, but burnt
asunder, somewhat near the ground, as the ends of them, being
<i>coaled</i>, do manifest.&nbsp; The oaks were lying in
multitudes, and of an extraordinary size, being five yards in
compass, and sixteen yards long; and some smaller of a greater
length, with a good quantity of acorns and small nuts near
them.&rdquo;&nbsp; Similar discoveries have been made in the fen
near Thorney; in digging the channel north of Lynn, called
Downham Eau; and in many other places.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>Mr Richard Atkins</i>, a gentleman of considerable
research, and a commissioner of sewers in the reign of James I.
was of opinion that the Fens were formerly meadow land, fruitful,
healthy, and lucrative to the inhabitants, <a
name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>from
affording relief to the people of the highlands in times of
drought.&nbsp; Peterborough, he observes, was of old called
Meadhamstead, on account of the meadows there, though most of the
present fens belong to that district.&nbsp; Likewise Ely, or
Peterborough Great Fen was once a forest.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In a Paper communicated to the Royal
Society by the reverend <i>John Rastrick</i> of Lynn, and
published in the Philosophical Transactions (No. 279, 1702) it is
mentioned, that on removing the foundation of the old sluice at
the end of Hammond&rsquo;s Bank, where it falls into Boston
Haven, the workmen discovered many roots of trees issuing from
their boles, or trunks, spread in the ground; and in taking them
up with the earth in which they were embedded, they met with a
solid gravelly and stony soil, of the high country kind, but
black and discoloured, from the length of years, and the change
which had befallen it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. <i>Elstobb</i>, in his Historical Account of the
Bedford Level, affirms, that in his perambulations over the
levels of Sutton and Mepal, and others adjacent, in the counties
of Cambridge and Huntingdon, he observed, at the depth of about
three feet under the present moorish soil, multitudes of roots of
large trees, standing as they had grown, from which the bodies
had manifestly been sawn off.&nbsp; Some of them he saw lying at
a small distance from their roots, at the depth above-mentioned;
and he was credibly informed that great numbers had been and were
still found severed and lying in the same manner.</p>
<p><a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
60</span>&ldquo;He also relates that in driving the piles for
securing the foundation of the great sluice at the mouth of the
new cut, a little above Boston, in 1764, roots of trees were
found at the depth of eighteen feet below the pasturage surface,
standing as the trees had grown.&nbsp; Some of them were obliged
to be chopt through to make a passage for the piles.&nbsp; In
some other parts of the trench dug for laying the same
foundations, small shells were discovered, disposed in the same
manner as they are often found at the bottom and sides of the
marsh creeks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The preceding instances are sufficient proofs, that the
surface of this level was anciently much lower than it is at
present; <a name="citation60"></a><a href="#footnote60"
class="citation">[60]</a> and also that it must have remained dry
for a vast number of years, otherwise the trees would never have
attained to the magnitude which they appear to have done by the
above statements.&nbsp; In what age, or from what causes the
waters overspread the country, and converted this extensive
district into fens, is uncertain; yet there are reasons to
believe, that the great level would have remained in a
flourishing state till the present time, if the operations of
nature had not been interrupted by the works of art.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Dugdale</i>, in a quotation from the Life of
Agricola, by Tacitus, says that &ldquo;the Britons complained
that their hands and bodies were worn out and consumed by <a
name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>the Romans,
in clearing the woods, and embanking the fens.&rdquo;&nbsp; This
sentence, when considered conjointly with the foregoing accounts
of the state in which the trees have been found, enables us to
form an idea of the time when the woods were destroyed, which
appears to have been before the Romans had secured the entire
possession of the island.&nbsp; Some of the trees, we find, were
<i>burnt</i>, and others <i>sawn</i> down, and this evidently
without any regard either to profit or utility, since the trunks
were left to perish on the soil where they grew.&nbsp; It is
probable therefore, that they were felled to deprive the Britons
of shelter, and to enable the Roman soldiers to march in greater
security, and obtain an easier conquest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The emperor <i>Severus</i> is said to have been the
first who intersected the fens with causeways.&nbsp;
<i>Dugdale</i> has mentioned one, supposed to have been made by
him, of twenty-four miles in length, extending from Denver to
Peterborough.&nbsp; This was composed of gravel, about three feet
in depth and sixty feet broad, and is covered with moor from
three to five feet in thickness.&nbsp; This furnishes another
proof of the great alterations which the fens have undergone; yet
the changes which have taken place may be illustrated still
further.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The celebrated <i>Sir Robert Cotton</i>, when making a
pool, at the edge of Connington Downs, in Huntingdonshire, found
the skeleton of a large sea-fish nearly twenty feet long, about
six feet below the superfices of the ground, and as much below
the general level of the fens.&nbsp; Many of the bones, which
from their long continuance in the earth, were incrusted with
stone, were preserved, <a name="page62"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 62</span>and are reported to be still in the
possession of Sir Robert&rsquo;s descendants.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At Whittlesea, in digging through the moor, for the
purpose of making a moat to secure a plantation of fruit trees,
at eight feet deep, a perfect soil was found, with swaths of
grass lying on it as they were at first mowed.&rdquo;&nbsp; This
seems to indicate that the inundation which overwhelmed the
country, happened in summer, or early in autumn, and had not been
foreseen by the inhabitants.&nbsp; The <i>nuts</i> and
<i>acorns</i> before-mentioned, will also corroborate this
conjecture, as to the time of the year when this catastrophe
happened; and so do the swaths of grass, or mown hay, as to the
suddenness of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the foundation was dug for Shirbeck sluice, near
Boston, at the depth of sixteen feet a <i>smith&rsquo;s forge</i>
was discovered embedded in silt, with all the <i>tools</i>
belonging to it, several <i>horse-shoes</i> and some other
articles.&nbsp; Also in setting down a sluice a little below
Magdalene Fall, a stone eight feet long and a cart wheel were
found at a similar depth below the surface.&nbsp; Likewise near
the river Welland, at the depth of ten feet, several boats were
dug up; and at the same depth, on the opposite side of the river,
the remains of ancient tan-vats or pits, and a great quantity of
horns were found.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Henry of Huntingdon</i>, who lived in the reign of
king Stephen, describes this fenny country as very pleasant and
agreeable to the eye, watered by many rivers which run through
it, diversified with many large and <a name="page63"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 63</span>small lakes, and adorned with many
woods and islands.&nbsp; <i>William of Malmsbury</i> also, who
lived till the first year of Henry II, has painted the state of
the land round Thorney in the most glowing colours.&nbsp; He
represents it as a paradise; the very marshes abounding in trees,
whose length, without knots, emulated the stars.&nbsp; The plain
there (says he) is as level as the sea, which with the
flourishing of the grass allureth the eye; and so smooth that
there is nothing to hinder him that runs through it; neither is
there any <i>waste</i> place in it; for in some parts there are
apple trees; in others vines, which either spread upon the
grounds, or run along the poles.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Making every allowance for the florid colouring of the above
representations, it is manifest that the level in the times of
the above writers must have been in a very flourishing and
superior condition to what it was a few centuries afterwards,
&ldquo;when the fens were covered with water, and the inhabitants
of many islands in danger of perishing for want of
food.&rdquo;&nbsp; Whatever occasioned the alteration, it clearly
appears that attempts at draining were made as early as the reign
of Edward I, and have been continued with various success to the
present time.&nbsp; The famous <i>John of Gaunt</i>, and
<i>Margaret countess of Richmond</i> were among the first
adventurers who embarked in this undertaking.&nbsp; They were
pretty soon succeeded by <i>bishop Morton</i>, whose patriotic
efforts, as has been already observed, were attended with
considerable success.</p>

<p class="gutsumm"><i>Of the Fens from the time of Henry</i>
VIII, <i>or rather that of Elizabeth</i>, <i>to the
Revolution</i>; <i>giving an account of the different projects of
improvement proposed and carried on during that period</i>.</p>
<p>During the successive reigns of Henry VIII, Edward VI, and
Mary I, little attention appears to have been paid to the state
or improvement of the fens.&nbsp; For most of that time, and ever
after the dissolution of the abbeys, to which a very great part
of these fens belonged, they were, it seems, almost entirely
neglected, and soon reduced to a very wretched condition: so
little care having been taken by the new possessors to keep the
drains open and the banks in repair, compared with what had been
done by their wiser predecessors, the abbots and the monks.</p>
<p>In Elizabeth&rsquo;s time, however, things were gotten to such
a pass as not to admit of being any longer overlooked or
neglected.&nbsp; The reign of that queen (as Mr <i>Gough</i>
observes in his edition of <i>Camden</i>) &ldquo;may be properly
fixed on as the period when the Great Level began to become
immediately a public care.&rdquo;&nbsp; In her 20th. year a
commission was granted to Sir Thomas Cecil, Sir William
Fitz-Williams, and others, to drain the fens about
<i>Clow&rsquo;s Cross</i>; but the inutility of such a partial
design appears to have been early foreseen, as there is no
account of the plan ever being acted upon.&nbsp; In her 43rd
year, an act of parliament was passed on a general plan, which
not only included the draining of the great level, but likewise
all the marshes and drowned lands in the kingdom.&nbsp; This
scheme, for which resources equal to <a name="page65"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 65</span>the extent of the undertaking are
said to have been provided, was frustrated by the queen&rsquo;s
death.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In the beginning of the reign of James I,
Sir <i>John Popham</i>, the Lord Chief Justice, procured an act
for draining the fens in the Isle of Ely, and the lands in the
adjacent counties.&nbsp; The work was commenced with great
spirit, but was soon retarded by the death of Popham, and
afterwards entirely dropt, through the opposition of some
land-owners, who conceived themselves injured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The persons who next attempted to proceed with this
important undertaking, were the <i>Earl of Arundel</i>, <i>Sir
William Ayloff</i>, <i>bart.</i> and <i>Anthony Thomas</i>,
<i>Esq.</i> but their proposals not being agreeable to those who
acted as commissioners on behalf of the proprietors, and much
time being lost by the meetings held to determine the contested
points, the <i>king</i> himself resolved to become an adventurer,
and actually undertook the herculean labour of draining the fens,
on condition of his receiving 120,000 acres, as a remuneration,
when the work was completed.&nbsp; This agreement was carried
into a law, and there the design terminated; for the political
embarrassments, which attended the remainder of the reign of the
fickle James, prevented a single step being taken to carry it
into execution.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the 6th year of Charles I. <i>Sir C. Vermuiden</i>, a
Hollander, in a contract with the Commissioners of Sewers,
engaged to drain the fens, on condition, that 90,000 <a
name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>acres of
land, when drained, should be transferred to him.&nbsp; But when
he had again surveyed the Level, and made drawings of the works
that were necessary, he appears to have thought the reward
insufficient, and demanded an additional allotment of 5000
acres.&nbsp; This proposal was rejected; more from the prejudices
that prevailed against him as a foreigner (and a disgust,
probably, for not standing to his first bargain) than from any
supposition that his demands were extravagant: for soon after,
the commissioners with the consent of the land-holders, engaged
on the same terms of 95,000 acres with <i>Francis Earl of
Bedford</i>, who had large possessions in the fens, through the
grant to his ancestors of Thorney Abbey and its appurtenances. <a
name="citation66"></a><a href="#footnote66"
class="citation">[66]</a></p>
<p><a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>Before
the commencement of the work, thirteen gentlemen, of high rank
and respectability offered to become joint adventurers with the
earl, and their proposals being accepted, the undertaking
commenced.&nbsp; In the year 1634, the king granted the
adventurers a charter of incorporation; and three years and a
half from that period, the Commissioners adjudged the Level
drained, and, accompanied by his Majesty&rsquo;s surveyor,
attended to set out the earl&rsquo;s allotment.</p>
<p>From this time the favourable disposition of Charles toward
the adventurers began to change; and early in the ensuing year,
1638, a meeting was held at Huntingdon, <a
name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>of people
devoted to the will of the crown, who were empowered to examine
into the utility of the measures executed by the Earl.&nbsp; The
new Commissioners declared that the works were incomplete; and
accepted the king&rsquo;s proposals to drain the fens, for which
he was to receive not only 95,000 acres, but also 57,000
additional!&nbsp; Every hope of advantage which Charles expected
to reap from this undertaking was entirely dissipated by the
ensuing troubles, which prevented every further prosecution of
the work till the year 1649, when <i>William earl of Bedford</i>,
Son and successor of <i>Francis</i>, was restored by the
Parliament to all the rights of his father.</p>
<p>The Act obtained at this period, settled the boundaries of the
Level, and gave fresh vigour to the undertaking.&nbsp; The works
which had fallen to decay, were repaired, and new channels made,
with so much propriety in the opinion of the Commissioners, that
on the 25th. of March, 1653, the Level was adjudged to be fully
drained, and the 95,000 acres awarded to the Earl and his
participants; the latter of whom were nearly ruined by the
expence of draining, which amounted to upwards of
&pound;400,000.</p>
<p>In the 15th. of Charles II, the former act was confirmed in
its most essential clauses; and a corporation, consisting of a
governor, six bailiffs, and twelve conservators and commonality,
was established, under the title of &ldquo;Conservators of the
Great Level of the Fens,&rdquo; for its better government.&nbsp;
These commissioners were empowered to levy taxes on the 95,000
acres, to defray <a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
69</span>whatever expences might arise in their preservation; but
only 83,000 acres were vested in the corporation, in trust for
the Earl of Bedford and his associates.&nbsp; The remaining
12,000 having been allotted to Charles I, in pursuance of the
agreement made by the persons who met at Huntingdon, were now
assigned to the king, with the exception of 2000 acres, which had
been granted to the Earl of Portland. <a name="citation69"></a><a
href="#footnote69" class="citation">[69]</a></p>
<p>Though the Corporation were invested with power by the above
act to levy taxes generally on the adventurers land, yet as the
form and manner in which that power was to be exercised was not
prescribed, they could only levy a specific sum on every acre; a
proceeding manifestly unjust; as the lands varied so much in
value, that an <i>equal</i> tax nearly amounted to the whole sum
the inferior lands were worth.&nbsp; Application was therefore
made to the Legislature for power to remedy this inconvenience,
by granting authority to substitute a gradual acre tax; and
commissioners were appointed by the Parliament to survey and rate
the land according to its value.&nbsp; Under this commission it
was sorted into eleven degrees, and that with so much
impartiality, that the proportional values as then ascertained,
have <a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>ever
since been regarded as a standard. <a name="citation70"></a><a
href="#footnote70" class="citation">[70]</a>&nbsp; Nothing very
material, or remarkable, in regard to the fens, appears to have
been done afterwards during the remainder of Charles&rsquo;
reign, or that of his brother and successor James.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Section</span> VIII.</h4>
<p class="gutsumm"><i>The same subject continued</i>, <i>front
the revolution to the present time</i>.</p>
<p>In the year 1697 the Bedford Level was divided into three
districts, North, Middle, and South; having one surveyor for each
of the former, and two for the latter.&nbsp; This distribution,
which had been made for its better government, was the source of
considerable divisions.&nbsp; A misconceived distinction of
interest arose between the different proprietors; and their
dissatisfaction being increased during a long minority in the
Bedford family, to whom, as proprietor of the North Level, the
others were greatly indebted.&nbsp; Application was made to the
Legislature in 1753, and an act obtained to settle the account of
the corporation, and separate the North Level from the rest,
except in those instances wherein their alliance was necessary
for the service of the country.&nbsp; On this occasion the Duke
of Bedford remitted the sum due to him from the South and Middle
Levels; and the Earl of Lincoln, to whom they were also indebted,
concurred in the generous example.</p>
<p><a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>Soon
after passing the above act, which separated the north from the
middle and south levels, a treaty was negociated between the
Bedford Level Corporation and the principal persons interested in
the trade carried on through the river Nene, from the Port of
Lynn to the counties of Huntingdon and Northampton.&nbsp; That
part of the river which lay within the boundaries of the great
Level, was so filled up by the silt and other matter, which the
tides and upland waters had deposited, that the navigation was
much impeded, and the expence of every voyage considerably
increased.&nbsp; This caused an application to the managers of
the Bedford Level, for their assistance in the necessary work of
cleansing the channel of the river, and making it deeper; and the
parties, after several meetings, agreed in the outlines of a plan
intended to answer the ends both of draining and
navigation.&nbsp; The same year, the persons interested applied
to Parliament; and the measures proposed for their mutual benefit
received the sanction of the legislature.&nbsp; By the act then
passed, the corporation of the Bedford Level renounce the general
power possessed over the river and its banks, and unite with a
stated number of land-proprietors, chosen from the south and
middle districts, in raising a <i>fund</i>, <a
name="citation71"></a><a href="#footnote71"
class="citation">[71]</a> to be appropriated to scour out and
deepen the bed of the Nene and its communicating branches.</p>
<p><a name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>The
above acts form the basis of the constitution appointed for the
government of the Bedford Level; for though many others have been
procured within the last 50 years, for draining separate
districts within its limits, yet they all contain a clause,
reserving the powers of the Corporation as established in the
15th Charles II.</p>
<p>Of late years a measure has been frequently agitated, and in
1795 passed into a law, for improving the outfall of the river
Ouse, and amending the drainage of the south and middle Levels,
by making a Cut across the marshes from Eaubrink to Lynn.&nbsp;
Great advantages are expected to be derived from this new
channel, and the commissioners appointed by the Act are now
employed in levying taxes to enable them to proceed with the
work; but it is not yet begun.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the various projects that have been executed
and the vast expence incurred to complete the drainage of the
Fens, the work is yet imperfect; and in many places the farmer is
still liable to have all the produce of his grounds carried away
by inundations.&nbsp; The peculiar situation of the Level, which
renders it the receiver of the collected waters of nine counties,
and the want of attention to those comprehensive measures which
alone could have equalled the evil, by providing a sufficient
<i>outlet</i> to the sea for the descending torrent, when <a
name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>swelled by
the numerous currents from the hills produced by a rainy season,
are frequently the occasion of high floods, by which many
thousand acres of prime land are overwhelmed and made useless for
the whole year.</p>
<p>Among the great variety of expedients employed to drain the
marshes, where the regular and common means have failed, is the
erection of windmills, or rather engines worked by the wind,
which, from their number and situation in some parts of the fens,
present a very singular and rather queer and grotesque
appearance.&nbsp; These raise the water to a sufficient height to
admit of its being conveyed into receptacles enough elevated to
carry it into its proper channel.</p>
<p>A great many thousand acres, within the extent of this low
country, are still in the condition of waste unimproved fen, the
average value of which is said to be little more than four
shillings an acre.&nbsp; One writer states that upwards of
150,000 acres are in that condition in Cambridgeshire alone, <a
name="citation73a"></a><a href="#footnote73a"
class="citation">[73a]</a> which, however, has been thought by
others somewhat inaccurate, and beyond the truth.&nbsp; Be that
as it may, the quantity of such lands in the fens is certainly
very great, and must sufficiently demonstrate that the immense
labour bestowed, in draining the Level, has not been attended
with the salutary effects which the promoters of the various
plans too fondly imagined and promised; and it may still be
questioned whether the remedies proposed, and partially executed,
are adequate to effect the intended purpose. <a

class="smcap">Section</span> IX.</h4>
<p class="gutsumm"><i>Miscellaneous Observations on the present
appearance</i>, <i>produce</i>, <i>and state of the Fens</i>.</p>
<p>The elevated spots on which the towns and villages are built
in many parts of the fens, appear like islands rising in the
midst of low and level marshes; and the churches being generally
erected on the highest parts, may be distinguished at the
distance of several miles.&nbsp; The cottages in many places are
nothing more than mud-walls, covered with thatch or reed.&nbsp;
The application of the land is various.&nbsp; The crops of oats
are particularly exuberant, the produce being frequently from
forty-five to sixty bushels an acre; great quantities of wheat
and coleseed are also grown, and generally with a proportional
increase.&nbsp; Many thousand acres are also appropriated to
pasture.</p>
<p>In the neighbourhood of Elm, Upwell, Outwell, &amp;c.
considerable quantities of hemp and flax are grown; but the
culture of these articles, as a preparation for wheat, does not
receive that attention which their importance demands.&nbsp; Some
very fine butter is made in the dairy farms in this district; and
the vicinity of Cottenham is famous for a peculiar kind of new
cheese of a singularly delicious flavour; which is partly
ascribed to the mode observed in the management of the dairies,
and partly to the nature of the herbage on the commons.&nbsp;
Many parts are remarkably favourable for the growth of corn; but
the situation of some of them renders them so extremely liable to
be overflowed, that their luxuriant produce is too frequently
destroyed by the floods. <a name="citation74"></a><a
href="#footnote74" class="citation">[74]</a>&nbsp; It is <a
name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>generally
said, however, that if the occupiers have one good year in every
two or three, they will make a very tolerable shift to
live.&nbsp; The sheep in some parts are said to be very subject
to the rot, which has been attributed to the neglected state of
the fens in those places, occasioning the ground to produce rank
and unwholesome herbage.</p>
<p>The grounds are perhaps no where richer or more fertile, in
any part of this low country, than about Wisbeach and Long
Sutton.&nbsp; The pastures there are exceedingly fine and
luxuriant.&nbsp; The crops of corn also are in general abundant,
but much more subject to blights than in the hilly parts, and the
grain is said to be lighter; and much inferior in quality to that
of the high country.</p>
<p>Towards March and Chatteris, the land, though apparently very
good, is said to be apt to produce such an increasing quantity of
thick moss, as renders it in a few years unfit for pasturage; to
remedy which, the farmer has the surface pared off and burnt,
preparatory to its being ploughed up; by which means the moss is
effectually destroyed, and a good manure provided for the ensuing
crops, which are for the most part very plentiful.&nbsp; After a
while it is again converted into grass land, and so continued
till the moss gathers and appears as before, when the former
process is again resorted to, as the only remedy.</p>
<p>One very great inconvenience, which the inhabitants of this
low country labour under, is the want of good <a
name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>water,
especially in dry summers, owing to the scarcity of
springs.&nbsp; Rain-water is the only water they can have for
domestic uses, almost throughout the year: to preserve which they
have troughs and spouts constructed and fixed under the eves of
the houses, by which it is conveyed into cisterns and reservoirs
for the use of their families.&nbsp; Even such populous towns as
Boston and Wisbeach have no better means of supplying themselves
with good water; which in most parts of Britain would be deemed
an intolerable grievance.&nbsp; To Lynn, however, the above case
does not apply.&nbsp; The country on its eastern side abounds
with good springs, from which the town is plentifully supplied
with excellent water, as not to be exceeded in that respect,
perhaps, by any place in the kingdom.</p>
<p>In Marshland and other parts of the country, it is with no
small difficulty that water can be procured for the cattle in
very dry seasons.&nbsp; Instances not few, are said to have been
known at such times, of their being driven daily some miles to
water, as none could be procured at a nearer distance.&nbsp; Such
is the spongy quality of the soil in these parts, that pits dug
to preserve the rain water would not retain it unless they were
previously bottomed with clay, by which the water is prevented
from sinking into the earth.&nbsp; Such pits are dug almost in
every field; and for all the care and expence bestowed upon them,
they are often found empty and useless long before the end of a
very dry summer.&nbsp; Thus it appears, that this country, so
fertile and desirable in some respects, has its advantages
greatly counter-balanced by some very <a name="page77"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 77</span>serious inconveniences, from which
the more hilly and sterile districts of the kingdom are happily
exempted.&nbsp; On the whole, when the advantages and
disadvantages of this low fertile country are fairly compared
with those of the more barren and mountainous regions, it will
probably be found that the favours of providence are much more
equally distributed than we are sometimes apt to imagine.</p>
<p>Here it may be further observed, that the system of
agriculture, and even the implements of husbandry are different
in marshland and the fens from those of the higher parts of
Norfolk; which is probably to be ascribed to the soil, or quality
of the land being very different in the one from what it is in
the other.&nbsp; In the former it is for the most part strong and
heavy, but weak and light in the latter, so as not to require
more than two horses to draw the plough, and which are uniformly
managed without a driver.</p>

continued&mdash;Fen reeds and their
uses&mdash;Starlings&mdash;Tame Geese</i>, <i>and singular
management of them&mdash;Insalubriousness of
Marshland&mdash;Ancient celebrity of the
Smeeth&mdash;Decoys</i>.</p>
<p>Many parts of the fens abound with a remarkable species of
<i>reeds</i>, which appear in summer, at some distance, like
extensive fields of corn.&nbsp; In autumn, and at the approach of
winter, they are resorted to by innumerable <a
name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>flocks of
Starlings, which then subsist upon the seeds of those plants, and
lodge or roost among their branches; from whence, when scared,
they ascend sometimes in such vast numbers as to appear in the
sky like a thick cloud, exhibiting a very strange and striking
spectacle to those beholders who are unused to the curious
phenomena of this singular country.&nbsp; The fen-fowlers, in
their long boats, take these birds sometimes by surprize, when
thickly assembled among those reeds, and with their long guns
make prodigious havock among them.&nbsp; Myriads of them are so
destroyed, and become a considerable article of food in the
latter months of the year.</p>
<p>The reeds to which these birds resort, and from whose seed,
for many months, they derive a great part of their subsistence,
are no less remarkable in another respect: vast quantities of
them are cut down, or reaped like corn, in the latter part of
summer; being afterward carefully dried and dressed, they are
tied up in bundles or sheaves, made up into stacks or ricks, and
sold for coverings of houses, making perhaps the best
<i>thatch</i> in the world.&nbsp; Great numbers of houses and
barns, and even some churches are covered with them about the
Fens and Marshland, and the adjoining parts of Norfolk.&nbsp;
They are laid on very thick, curiously, and judiciously, and
constitute a very durable, as well as neat covering, which is
said to last sometimes thirty or forty years, with a little
shaving and trimming.&nbsp; It has been observed of thatch
coverings (those made of these reeds must be particularly so)
that they make the coolest houses in summer, and the warmest in
winter of all coverings whatever; <a name="page79"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 79</span>being more impervious both to heat
and cold than any other materials used for the same
purpose.&nbsp; Thatching is executed in this country in a style
of superior neatness, as well as firmness, and better calculated
for durability, than the writer of this has known any where else
except, perhaps, in the <i>Vale of Glamorgan</i>, where a similar
method is used.&nbsp; The material there, indeed is wheat straw,
and not reeds, which in that country cannot be obtained in any
large quantity; but the process of dressing and preparing the
materials, as well as the method of laying them on, seem to be
there and here much alike.&nbsp; It seems somewhat remarkable
that districts so widely separated, and which are in most other
respects so very dissimilar, should yet in this particular bear
so near and striking a resemblance to each other. <a
name="citation79a"></a><a href="#footnote79a"
class="citation">[79a]</a></p>
<p>Some parts of the Fens, especially on the Lincolnshire side,
have been long famous for breeding vast flocks of tame
<i>Geese</i>, of which great numbers are usually sent alive to
the London markets.&mdash;They have also a remarkable custom of
<i>plucking</i> the geese, and stripping them of their quills and
feathers repeatedly every year, <a name="citation79b"></a><a
href="#footnote79b" class="citation">[79b]</a> and so render each
of them conformable to <i>Plato&rsquo;s</i> <a
name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>memorable
definition of <i>man</i>, &ldquo;a two-legged, unfeathered
animal:&rdquo; in which view it might be called <i>humanizing</i>
the poor geese, or converting them into so many human
beings.&nbsp; The practice however, has been by many thought
<i>inhuman</i>, and barbarous, as it must put the poor creatures
into no small degree of pain; <a name="citation80a"></a><a
href="#footnote80a" class="citation">[80a]</a> but as it is
gainful to the owners, in yielding them a far greater quantity of
feathers than they would otherwise produce, there is no great
prospect of its being very soon, if ever, discontinued.</p>
<p>The geese, during the breeding season, are lodged in the same
houses with the inhabitants, and even in their very
bedchambers.&nbsp; In every apartment are three rows of coarse
wicker pens, placed one above another.&nbsp; Each bird has a
separate lodge, divided from the other, which it keeps possession
of during the time of sitting.&nbsp; A gozzard, or gooseherd,
attends the flock, and twice a day drives the whole to water,
then brings them back to their habitation, helping those that
live in the upper stories to their nests, without ever misplacing
a single bird. <a name="citation80b"></a><a href="#footnote80b"
class="citation">[80b]</a></p>
<p>Another odd custom in some parts of this same country, is that
of preparing <i>cow-dung</i>, and converting it into <i>fuel</i>,
by forming it, in a wet state, into the shape <a
name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>of turf, and
afterward drying it in the sun.&nbsp; It yields a strong
disagreeable smell in burning, besides its depriving the farmer
of a very large quantity of his best manure.&nbsp; Materials for
fuel must, surely, have been very scarce in the country when this
strange expedient or substitute was first adopted.</p>
<p>Marshland and the Fens are not deemed healthy, except,
perhaps, to consumptive persons, who are said to be sometimes
sent thither on account of the softness of the air.&nbsp; To most
others the country is unhealthy, and subject to aguish disorders,
which has always been the case, it seems, especially in
Marshland; hence an ague is in Norfolk proverbially called <i>the
Marshland Bailiff</i>, and a person afflicted with that disorder
is said to be <i>arrested by the Bailiff of
Marshland</i>.&mdash;Instead of hedgerows the fields are here
generally enclosed with deep dikes, which for the most part of
the year are filled with water, to which, probably, we are
chiefly to ascribe the unhealthiness of the country; or rather to
the putrid state of these dikes and stagnant waters, in the
latter part of summer and the autumn. <a name="citation81"></a><a
href="#footnote81" class="citation">[81]</a></p>
<p><a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 82</span>In
passing along the road through this remarkable country, a
stranger, from the hilly parts, cannot help being struck at first
sight with the strange appearance of gates and gate-posts erected
all about, without any hedges or visible enclosures to indicate
either the necessity, or yet the utility of them; for as the
dikes are not perceptable at a distance, the land on every side
appears in many places like a great open field.&nbsp; A little
time and reflection, however, generally rectify the wondering
traveller&rsquo;s judgment.</p>
<p>The soil of Marshland is for the most part very good and rich;
but no where more so than in that notable tract called the
<i>Smeeth</i>, which has been long celebrated for its uncommon
fertility.&nbsp; Till lately it was all a common belonging to the
seven towns of Marshland; and old Authors used to relate that it
constantly fed 30,000 Sheep, with abundance besides of the great
cattle of the seven towns.&nbsp; So famous was this tract for the
richness and luxuriance of its soil, at the accession of
<i>James</i> I, that a courtier is said to have mentioned it then
to that monarch, <a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
83</span>as one of the most fertile spots in all his English
dominions; adding &ldquo;that if over night a wand or rod were
laid on the bare ground, it would, by the next morning, be
covered with grass, of that night&rsquo;s growth, so as not then
to be discerned.&rdquo;&nbsp; To which his majesty is said
jocosely to reply, &ldquo;that some parts of <i>Scotland</i> far
exceeded that, for that he himself knew some grounds there, where
if an <i>horse</i> were put in over night it could not be
discerned the next morning;&rdquo; alluding, it seems, to some of
the bogs in that country.&mdash;The Smeeth has been of late
enclosed, drained, and considerably improved.&nbsp; A great part
of it has been ploughed up, and the crops produced are said to be
in general very abundant, and likely to continue so.&nbsp; It may
therefore be presumed, that the enclosing of the Smeeth will
prove no detriment, but rather an advantage to the public; and
also that its celebrity, as a most fertile spot, will not be
diminished by its being no longer an open and unimproved
common.</p>
<p>These parts have been long noted for great numbers of
<i>Decoys</i>.&nbsp; They are said to be now much less numerous
than formerly, owing, seemingly, to the various and progressive
improvements that have taken place of late years, especially in
Lincolnshire, and the consequent decrease of the aquatic
wild-fowl.&nbsp; There are still, however, a good many decoys to
be found in different places, of which the best is said to be
that of <i>Lakenheath</i>, on the borders of Suffolk, from which
very considerable numbers of aquatic wild-fowl of different kinds
are usually sent to the London Markets.&mdash;An authentic
account <a name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>of
this singular and curious contrivance, it being in general but
ill understood, and but imperfectly described in books, shall be
here inserted, as it is presumed it will not prove unacceptable
to the reader.</p>
<p>A decoy is generally made where there is a large pond
surrounded with wood, and beyond that a marshy uncultivated
country.&nbsp; If the piece of water is not thus surrounded, it
will be attended with the noise and other accidents, which may be
expected to frighten the wild-fowl from a quiet haunt where they
mean to sleep during the day time in security.&nbsp; If such
noises or disturbances are wilful, an action will lie against the
disturbers.&nbsp; As soon as the evening sets in, the decoy
<i>rises</i> (as the term is) and the wild fowl feeds during the
night.&nbsp; If the evening be still, the noise of their wings,
during their flight, is heard at a very great distance, and is a
pleasing, though melancholy sound.&nbsp; The <i>rising</i> of the
decoy in the evening is, in Somersetshire, called
<i>radding</i>.&nbsp; The decoy-ducks are fed with hempseed,
which is thrown over the skreen in small quantities, to bring
them forward into the pipes or canals, and to allure the
wild-fowl to follow as this seed floats.&nbsp; There are several
<i>pipes</i>, as they are called, which lead up a narrow ditch
that closes at last with a funnel net.&nbsp; Over these pipes,
(which grow narrower from their first entrance) is a continued
arch of netting, suspended on hoops.&nbsp; It is necessary to
have a pipe, or ditch for almost every wind that can blow, as
upon this circumstance it depends which pipe the fowl will take
to; and the Decoy-man always keeps on the <i>windward</i> side of
the ducks, holding <a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
85</span>near his mouth a lighted turf, to prevent his breath or
effluvia reaching their sagacious nostrils.&nbsp; All along each
pipe, at certain intervals are placed skreens, made of reeds, so
situated and contrived, that it is impossible the wild fowl
should see the decoy-man before they have passed on toward the
end of the pipes where the purse net is placed.&nbsp; The
inducement of the wildfowl to go up one of these pipes is,
because the decoy-ducks, trained to this, lead the way, either
after hearing the whistle of the decoy-man, or enticed by the
hempseed: the latter will dive underwater or swim quietly away,
while the wildfowl fly on and are taken in the purse net.&nbsp;
It often happens, however, that the wildfowl are in such a state
of sleepiness and dozing, that they will not follow the
decoy-ducks.&nbsp; Use is then generally made of a dog, that has
been taught his lesson: he passes backward and forward, between
the reed skreens, (in which are little holes, both for the
decoy-man to see, and the little dog to pass through); this
attracts the eye of the wild-fowl, who, not choosing to be
interrupted, advance toward the small contemptible animal, that
they may drive him away.&nbsp; The dog all the time, by the
directions of the decoy-man, plays among the skreens of reeds
nearer and nearer to the purse net; till at last, perhaps, the
decoy-man appears behind a skreen, and the wild-fowl not daring
to pass by him in return, nor being able to escape upward, on
account of the net covering, rush on into the purse net.&nbsp;
Sometimes the dog will not attract their attention, unless a red
handkerchief, or something very singular be put about him.&nbsp;
<a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>The
general season for catching fowls in Decoys is from the end of
October till February; the taking of them earlier is prohibited
by an act of 10. Geo. II. c. 32. which forbids it from June 1, to
October 1, under a penalty of 5<i>s.</i> for each bird destroyed
within that time.&nbsp; Most of the Decoys of this kingdom are in
the Counties bordering on the great level of the Fens.&nbsp;
There are some also in Somersetshire.&nbsp; Lincolnshire used to
be the most noted county for its decoys, and it is probably so
still.&nbsp; Amazing numbers of ducks, widgeons and teals, used
to be taken there and sent to the London markets.&nbsp; Some
years ago, within one season, and from ten decoys in the
neighbourhood of Waynfleet, the number amounted to 31,200 in
which were included several other species of ducks.&nbsp; The
decoys are said to be commonly let at a certain annual rent, from
10 to a &pound;100.&nbsp; It was customary formerly to have in
the fens an annual driving of the young ducks before they took
wing.&nbsp; Numbers of people assembled on the occasion, who beat
a vast tract, and forced the birds into a net placed at the spot
where, the sport was to terminate.&mdash;150 dozens have been
taken at once; but the practice being thought detrimental, has
been abolished by act of Parliament.</p>

<p class="gutsumm"><i>Brief remarks on the parish churches of
Marshland and Holland</i>; <i>with a short sketch of the history
of the town and castle of Wisbeach</i>.</p>
<p>By those who have visited Marshland, nothing, perhaps, has
been more admired than its parish churches, some of which are
very large and stately: that of <i>Walpole St. Peters</i> is
eminently so, and deemed one of the most beautiful parish or
country churches in the kingdom.&nbsp; It is built of freestone,
and consists of a nave, two aisles, and a chancel, all covered
with lead.&nbsp; The tower corresponds with the other parts of
the building, being a very handsome stone structure
embattled.&nbsp; This edifice was founded near the close of the
reign of Henry V. and completed in the first or second year of
that of his successor.&nbsp; In one of the upper windows of the
south aisle of this church is said to be a most absurd and
profane representation of the Supreme Being, habited in a loose
purple gown, with a long beard, resting his right hand on a staff
of gold, and crowned with glory; pointing out the forefinger of
his left hand, as dictating to the Virgin Mary, who is seated
before him, with a pen in her hand, and paper on a desk before
her.&nbsp; The Deity stands at the door or entrance of a castle,
embattled, and with turrets, surrounded by a wall embattled;
within this wall is the virgin; and many angels are looking down
from the tower.&mdash;Here it may be observed, that when
superstition has taken hold of the mind, there is scarce any
thing too absurd to be imagined, or too impious to be
received.&nbsp; Sad and shocking must be the <a
name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>state of
religion in a country where men are employed in making pictures
or images of the deity, or where such images and pictures are
preserved, or suffered to exist in places of worship.&nbsp; It
would not, surely, be to the discredit of the minister and
parishioners of Walpole to have the above preposterous and
profane representation defaced, or removed.</p>
<p>Marshland indeed must not be thought singular, among the
several districts of this flat and stoneless country, for the
largeness, stateliness, and elegance of its churches.&nbsp; The
case is much the same in the adjoining district of <i>Holland</i>
in Lincolnshire, and in most of the northern parts of
Cambridgeshire.&nbsp; In no part of England are to be seen larger
or handsomer country churches.&nbsp; They are mostly built with
good freestone, and yet there is no freestone, or any other
stones here to be found, but what have been brought from a great
distance.&nbsp; Where the stones used in building these churches
were procured, seems to be unknown to the men of this
generation.&nbsp; They must have been brought a very great way,
and conveyed by water carriage, as the expence would otherwise
have been enormous and unsupportable.&nbsp; Some, indeed, will
tell us, that the masons and carpenters worked then for a
<i>penny a day</i>, and that other labour was in the same
proportion; but they seem to forget that their penny was worth a
great deal more than ours.&nbsp; Money, in this country, has
greatly sunk in its value since that time.&nbsp; A penny would
then, probably, go as far as 2s. or half a crown of our money; so
that, at any rate, the expence of the erection of these churches
must have <a name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
89</span>been very great, and such as the present inhabitants,
with all their boasted wealth and resources, would hardly (or
rather, not at all) be equal to.</p>
<p>With sumptuous seats and magnificent palaces it does not
appear that this country did ever much abound.&nbsp; Its strength
might be too much exhausted in building churches, to admit of
undertaking any other very expensive edifices.&nbsp; The Castle
of Wisbeach seems to be almost the only exception; which, though
situated a few yards out of the limits of Marshland, it may not
be altogether improper to give here a short sketch of its
history, as well as that of Wisbeach itself.</p>
<p>Of that town little is known before the conquest.&nbsp;
Sometime previous to that event, and in the early part of the
same century (the 11th) it is said to have been given to the
Convent of Ely (along with other large and important possessions
in the different counties of Cambridge, Norfolk and Suffolk) by
<i>Oswy</i> and <i>Leoflede</i>, the parents of <i>Alwyn</i>,
afterwards bishop of Elmham, upon his admission into the said
convent.&nbsp; As the property of a convent, or monastery, it may
be presumed to have been of old a very <i>religious</i> town;
which character it seems still in no small degree to retain,
though in a different way.</p>
<p>Of its Castle, however, no traces are known to exist before
the arrival of the Norman, with his conquering array of
Frenchmen.&nbsp; In 1071, five years subsequent to <a
name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>that event,
the conqueror, it is said, built here a stone Castle, the
governor of which was dignified with the title of
<i>constable</i>, and the walls and moat were ordered to be kept
in repair by the proprietors of certain lands in West Walton, who
held their estates by a tenure to that effect.&nbsp; This
fortress is supposed to have been afterwards dismantled in the
reign of Henry II, but upon what occasion we are not
informed.&nbsp; Nor have we any account of another such edifice
at Wisbeach till the reign of Henry VII, when a new Castle of
brick appears to have been built on the site of the former,
between the years 1478 and 1483, by bishop Morton, already
mentioned as an eminent benefactor to the adjacent country.&nbsp;
This new edifice became the said bishop&rsquo;s palace, in which
he and several of his successors afterwards resided.</p>
<p>In Mary&rsquo;s time the place seems to have undergone some
change, but whether so as to cease being an episcopal residence,
or not, does not appear.&nbsp; But we find that some part of it,
at least, was then appropriated for the confinement of heretics,
that is, of protestants.&nbsp; The names of two of these, who
were inhabitants of the town, are still upon record.&nbsp; One of
them was William Woolsey, and the other Robert Pygot.&nbsp; They
were for sometime confined in this Castle, and afterwards removed
to Ely, where they were both burnt, and along with them a great
heap of books, which seems to imply, that one of them at least
was a scholar, or considerable reader, and that, probably, was
Woolsey; for it appears that Pygot was by trade a painter, and
therefore not very likely to be possessed of many books.&nbsp; He
is spoken of as remarkably <a name="page91"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 91</span>meek and modest, whereas Woolsey was
a person of uncommon courage and boldness, viewing the impending
danger without dismay, and setting his unfeeling persecutors, and
even death itself at defiance.&nbsp; He was, it seems, somewhat
fearful lest the gentleness of his fellow-sufferer should give
his enemies advantage over him and occasion his recanting; but it
did not prove so: Pygot stood firm to his principles; and when
the commissioners presented a paper for him to sign, he said,
&ldquo;No, that is your faith, and not mine.&rdquo;&nbsp; They
suffered, towards the latter part of the year 1555. <a
name="citation91"></a><a href="#footnote91"
class="citation">[91]</a></p>
<p>In the reign of Elizabeth, the then bishop, or bishops, it
seems, relinquished this castle for the use and accommodation of
the civil power; and it was then converted into a state prison
for the papists, who were charged with conspiring against her
majesty&rsquo;s government.&nbsp; Great numbers therefore of
these people suffered here a long and rigorous imprisonment, and
not a few of them miserably perished in its dreary
dungeons.&nbsp; That queen amply retaliated upon the papists what
her sister Mary had before inflicted upon the protestants.&nbsp;
It is hard to say which of these crowned sisters was the most
bloody.&nbsp; Fox has largely described the cruelties and
atrocities of Mary&rsquo;s government.&nbsp; Certain popish, as
well as protestant nonconformist historians have done the same in
regard to that of Elizabeth: and if the intolerance, iniquity,
and cruelty of the latter reign did not exceed those of the
former, it seems pretty clear that they fell not short of <a
name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 92</span>them.&nbsp;
As to the number of victims, or sufferers, the preponderance is
evidently on the side of Elizabeth.&nbsp; There was a difference,
indeed, in the process or mode of immolation: Mary had her
victims burnt at the stake; whereas her protestant sister had
hers hanged, cut down alive, emboweled, and quartered.&nbsp;
Which of the two modes is the most humane and defensible&mdash;or
rather, which of them is the most barbarous and brutal, the
present writer will not attempt to determine.&nbsp; Nor will he
pretend to say which of the two is attended with the greatest
degree of animal pain, as that may depend upon
circumstances.&nbsp; But if burning be the most cruel of all
executions, as a very able living writer has observed, it argues
a defect in our laws, which appoints this to be the punishment of
petty treason, whilst the Catholic sufferers underwent that
annexed to high treason.&nbsp; He also observes with respect to
the greater part of those victims,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;that the sentence of the law was strictly
and literally executed upon them.&nbsp; After being hanged up,
they were cut down alive, dismembered, ripped up, and their
bowels literally burnt before their faces, after which they were
beheaded and quartered.&nbsp; The time employed in this butchery
was very considerable, and, in one instance, lasted above half an
hour.&mdash;Great numbers also of these sufferers, (he adds) as
well as other Catholics, who did not endure capital punishment,
were racked in the most severe and wanton manner, in order to
extort proofs against themselves or their brethren.&nbsp; It
appears, (he further observes) from the account of one of these
sufferers, that the following tortures were in use against the
Catholics in the Tower: [and probably also <a
name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>in the Castle
of Wisbeach:] 1. The common rack, in which the limbs were
stretched by levers.&nbsp; 2. The scavenger&rsquo;s daughter, so
called, being a hoop, in which the body was bent until the head
and feet met together.&nbsp; 3. The chamber, called Little-Ease,
being a hole so small that a person could neither stand, sit, or
lie straight in it.&nbsp; 4. The Iron Gauntlets.&nbsp; In some
instances needles were thrust under the prisoner&rsquo;s
nails.&mdash;Sir Owen Hopton, lieutenant of the Tower, was
commonly the immediate instrument in these cruelties there; but
sometimes Elmer [ Aylmer] bishop of London directed them.&rdquo;
<a name="citation93"></a><a href="#footnote93"
class="citation">[93]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>How far the bishop of Ely was concerned with similar
proceedings at the Castle of Wisbeach, we are not informed; but
whether he was concerned or not, we may presume that similar
measures were pursued there.&nbsp; The Wisbeach prisoners were
distinguished, not only for their numbers, amounting to some
scores, at least, but also for their rank and eminence, being
mostly priests and scholars, who had been educated either at
Oxford and Cambridge, or at some of the foreign
universities.&nbsp; Hence when their more illiterate, or
uneducated brethren, in other prisons, were called to defend
their tenets against the attacks or arguments of the clergy, they
would be expressing their wishes that some of their more learned
friends, from Wisbeach Castle, would be allowed to take their
part: and when the judge, at the trial of Barkworth, at the Old
Baily, sneeringly proposed his being tried by a <i>jury of
priests</i>, &ldquo;<i>That</i> is right,&rdquo; replied the
prisoner; &ldquo;Your lordship knows that a complete jury <a
name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>of them may
be found at Wisbeach Castle.&rdquo; <a name="citation94a"></a><a
href="#footnote94a" class="citation">[94a]</a>&nbsp; In short,
many of these catholic sufferers under Elizabeth, appear to have
been no less sincere and devout, and even, no less unjustly
treated, than those protestants, whose cruel sufferings have
rendered Mary&rsquo;s reign so deservedly detestable.</p>
<p>For a good while after the accession of James I, Wisbeach
Castle was still used for the same purpose as above described:
but between the years 1609 and 1619, it is said to have been
repaired by bishop Andrews, <a name="citation94b"></a><a
href="#footnote94b" class="citation">[94b]</a> who probably
occupied it himself for some time after.&nbsp; On the abolition
of the hierarchy, after the death of Charles I, it was purchased
by the memorable secretary Thurloe, <a name="page95"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 95</span>who rebuilt it in its present form,
from a design of the celebrated Inigo Jones: but though still
called <i>The Castle</i>, it no longer retained any appearance of
a fortress.&nbsp; At the restoration it reverted to the see of
Ely, but does not appear to have been ever afterwards an
episcopal residence.&nbsp; It was from that period usually
granted on lease to some one or other of the principal families
of the town; the Southwells, in particular had it a long while,
and resided there.&nbsp; Of late it has been sold, under an act
of parliament, by the late bishop, to Joseph Medworth, Esq.&nbsp;
The detached buildings have been since removed, and some rows of
elegant houses have been erected.&nbsp; The plan of a large
Circus has also been laid out, about one half of which is already
built: when the design is completed it will add greatly to the
pleasantness and beauty of the town.&nbsp; The Castle is still
standing, and likely to stand, with what may be called fair play,
as long as any of the new buildings, although it has been built
now above 150 years, and was, at the time of the sale,
<i>stated</i> (even by his lordship, it seems) to be in a decayed
and ruinous condition.</p>
<p>The parish church of Wisbeach, dedicated to St. Peter and St.
Paul, is a spacious handsome fabric, though of a very singular
construction, being furnished with two naves and two
aisles.&nbsp; The naves are lofty and separated from each other
by a row of light slender pillars, with pointed arches.&nbsp; The
aisles are the most ancient, being divided from their respective
naves by low massy pillars, and semicircular saxon arches.&nbsp;
The tower is deemed <a name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
96</span>very beautiful, and has been thought ancient, but its
claim to antiquity is said to be fully refuted by existing
records, which prove its erection to have been posterior to the
10th of March 1520.&mdash;On the west side of the north entrance
is a small chapel or chantry dedicated to St. Martin, and
originally endowed with lands for the maintenance of a priest, to
say masses for the soul of the founder.&nbsp; The church is a
vicarage, said to be heretofore worth 500<i>l.</i> a year, but
now, it seems, more than double that sum, in consequence of a
late litigation, which terminated in favour of the vicar, and the
complete discomfiture of his opponents.&nbsp; This is said to
have occasioned not a little ill blood between the good pastor
and some of his flock; but however that may affect them, so large
an addition of income will probably prevent his laying it very
deeply to heart.&nbsp; It may, however, perhaps be somewhat
doubtful, if the present extraordinary juncture, and most
eventful period, be altogether the most safe or proper for the
clergy to promote or engage in these unconciliatory and offensive
litigations.</p>
<p>Besides the parish church, there are at Wisbeach six other
different places of worship; one belonging to the <i>friends</i>,
commonly called <i>Quakers</i>, one to the <i>Independents</i>,
or <i>Culymites</i>, one to the <i>Wesleyan Methodists</i>, and
three to those of the <i>baptist</i> denomination.&nbsp; Between
the latter, though they all go under the same name, there yet
exist some strong shades of difference, so that very little of
any thing like good understanding or christian harmony is
discoverable.&nbsp; Yet they all lie, more or less, under the
imputation of heterodoxy, from <a name="page97"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 97</span>the great or main body of their
brethren, who are usually termed <i>particular
baptists</i>,&mdash;as well as from the rest of the right
orthodox clans.&nbsp; Of these three societies one belongs to a
certain order or description of arminian or general baptists, who
are pretty numerous about Leicestershire and the adjacent
counties, and also in some other parts.&nbsp; Except on the point
of baptism, they agree very much with the Wesleyans, and may,
perhaps, without much impropriety, be called <i>Wesleyan
baptists</i>.&mdash;Another of these three societies belongs to a
small party of baptists, sometimes called <i>Johnsonians</i>,
from the late John Johnson of Liverpool, to whose peculiar tenets
and spirit they are very much attached; and they have, seemingly,
but little charity or forbearance towards any thing that does not
come up to, or accord with that standard; which may be said to be
the worst trait in their character.&nbsp; They are otherwise
respectable, and so are the members of the society before
mentioned.&nbsp; Less bigotry would make both more amiable and
more respectable.&nbsp; The people who constitute the other
baptist society assume the name of <i>Unitarians</i>, and belong
to a notable class of that denomination which is said to be now
much on the increase in different parts of the kingdom.&nbsp; The
leaders of this new religious class profess to have for their
main object to restore Christianity to its original purity: they
adopt a popular strain of preaching, and are by some people
looked upon as highly <i>evangelical</i>; so that, as we have had
for some time <i>evangelical trinitarians</i>, both in the church
and out of it, we are now, it seems, to have likewise
<i>evangelical </i><a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
98</span><i>unitarians</i>.&nbsp; Some zealots among the orthodox
will probably nibble at this, and even pronounce it absolutely
impossible; but the pastor of the said society, at Wisbeach, is
said to be ready to maintain, against the very best man among his
opponents, not only that those of his connection are really <i>no
less evangelical</i>, but even much <i>more so</i> than any of
those on whom it has been the fashion of late years to bestow
that honourable appellation.&nbsp; Nothing further needs here be
said on the subject: the public will have an opportunity to judge
for themselves, if any one will enter the lists, or step forward
to discuss the point with the said pastor.</p>
<p>To have among its inhabitants so many different religious
societies or sects, can be no real reproach to Wisbeach.&nbsp;
The exercise of free enquiry, and unrestrained judgement and
decision in matters of religion, must be the undoubted and
unalienable birthright of every rational being, or moral agent:
nor can a diversity of religious sentiments or persuasions be any
way detrimental to the welfare of the community, provided all
parties were earnestly to concur in promoting general harmony and
goodwill among their fellow citizens.&nbsp; It is, however, much
to be regretted that this has been hitherto but very imperfectly
learnt and practised by most of our religious fraternities, both
in the establishment and out of it.&nbsp; It is too generally the
case, that the leaders of the respective parties promote among
their adherents a hostile, and not unfrequently a most rancorous
spirit towards their differing neighbours: and the higher men are
placed on the scale of orthodoxy and evangelicalism, the more <a
name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 99</span>apt are they
in general to run into this enormity.&nbsp; It would seem as if
they had taken their ideas, not from Jesus Christ, but rather
from those over-zealous and mistaken disciples who would fain
have confined the name and profession, as well as the propagation
of Christianity to those, forsooth, who would <i>follow
them</i>.&nbsp; Wherever real liberty exists, a diversity of
religious opinions and denominations must be expected; but that
would furnish no just cause of complaint, were the above evil
sufficiently guarded against by all parties.&nbsp; Acts of
uniformity in religion, attended with national creeds, tests, and
articles of faith, may suit the piety of popes, or the crooked
policy of despotism, but they can never accord with the rights of
man, or the true principles of freedom: they will never be
admitted in a land of liberty, and can belong only to those
hateful regions inhabited by slaves and governed by tyrants.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Section</span> XII.</h4>
<p class="gutsumm"><i>History of Wisbeach continued</i>.</p>
<p>Wisbeach was formerly a parliamentary borough, and that as
early as the reign of Edward I. <a name="citation99"></a><a
href="#footnote99" class="citation">[99]</a>&nbsp; The exact time
when it ceased to be so, does not appear.&nbsp; That privilege
was afterward restored to it under the protectorate, but
withdrawn again at the restoration, and never restored since;
while such insignificant places as Castle-Rising and others of a
similar description, still continue (absurdly and ridiculously
enough, it <a name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
100</span>must be said) to enjoy that privilege.&nbsp; Were such
paltry places disfranchised, to make room for the admission of
such as Manchester, Birmingham, Leeds, and Sheffield, it would
appear very reasonable; but as that is not at present to be
looked for, we will here dismiss the subject.</p>
<p>Ever since the reign of Edward VI. Wisbeach has been a
corporate town, but of a sort most singular and whimsical, and at
the same time the most harmless that can well be thought
of.&nbsp; Had all our corporations been like it, there would have
been, it is presumed, not much reason to complain of them.&nbsp;
This corporation appears to have emanated from a religious
fraternity, called the Guild of the Holy Trinity, instituted in
1379, and possessed of estates for pious and charitable
purposes.&nbsp; This establishment shared the general fate of
ecclesiastical foundations in the reign of Henry VIII; but Edward
VI, on his accession to the throne, having passed an act which
provided for the security of those institutions that had been
originally founded, either as grammar-schools, for relief of poor
persons, or for the maintenance of &ldquo;piers, jetties, walls,
or banks against the rage of the sea, &amp;c.&rdquo; the
inhabitants of Wisbeach availed themselves of the statute, and
through the solicitations of Gooderich, bishop of Ely, were
elevated into a corporation, on the 1st of June, 1549, and
invested with all the possessions of Trinity Guild, (lying in
eight different parishes, and occupied by thirty-nine tenants)
the revenues of which were then estimated at 28<i>l.</i>
2<i>s.</i> 3&frac12;<i>d.</i> but were, undoubtedly, much
greater. <a name="citation100"></a><a href="#footnote100"
class="citation">[100]</a></p>
<p><a name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 101</span>By
king Edward&rsquo;s charter the inhabitants were directed to
assemble annually, and elect <i>ten men</i>, who were to have the
direction of the <i>business</i> of the body-corporate: yet for
the first thirty six years after the charter was obtained, they
seem to have done little else than meet, once a month in the
town-hall, and, &ldquo;out of mutual love and amity,&rdquo;
immediately adjourn to a tavern, where having <i>dined</i>, <a
name="citation101"></a><a href="#footnote101"
class="citation">[101]</a> they decided petty controversies among
the inhabitants.&nbsp; Afterwards they proceeded further than
they were warranted by the charter: they took cognizance of the
accounts of the churchwardens, and surveyors of the highways;
they directed the application of money over which they had no
right; assumed the privilege of levying an acre-tax; and
moreover, during the <i>plague</i>, which raged here in 1588 and
1588, they summoned delinquents before them, and punished them at
their own pleasure.</p>
<p>On the 28th of January 1610&ndash;11, the inhabitants obtained
a renewal of their charter, at the great expence of 193<i>l.</i>
19<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i>&nbsp; They were then constituted a
body-corporate, by the style of &ldquo;the Burgesses of the town
of Wisbeach;&rdquo; but the right of election of the <i>ten
men</i>, thenceforward named &ldquo;Capital Burgesses,&rdquo; was
limited to the possessors of freeholds of the value of
40<i>s.</i> a year.&nbsp; From this period the said ten
<i>men</i>, as we are informed, became objects of veneration and
confidence, and were entrusted with the care of nearly all the
donations for the benefit of the poor.</p>
<p><a name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>On
the 17th of February 1669 they obtained a <i>second</i> renewal
or confirmation of their charter; on what occasion we cannot
discover.&nbsp; Their executive officer is the
<i>Town-Bailiff</i>, <a name="citation102"></a><a
href="#footnote102" class="citation">[102]</a> who, though a
person wholly unknown to the charter, has the entire management
of the estates and affairs of the corporation.&nbsp; He is not at
liberty, however, to expend more than 5<i>l.</i> at one time,
without an express order of the body-corporate.&mdash;These
Capital Burgesses have no connection with the jurisprudence of
the town, her have they any degree of civil authority, as the
civil government of the town is not distinct from the general
magistracy of the Isle of Ely, in which it stands: their
principal business is to regulate the management of the revenues
of the estates bequeathed, partly for charitable, but chiefly for
public purposes.&nbsp; The income, of which they direct the
expenditure, amounts to about 800<i>l.</i> annually; and to the
credit and honour of the parties concerned, we are told, that it
appears to be not only honestly, but even wisely expended.&nbsp;
Part of the said sum arises from a grant made to the corporation
by the Trinity House, in 1710, of one penny per ton upon all
goods exported and imported, for the purpose of maintaining buoys
and beacons, and keeping clear the channel of the river.</p>
<p>Among other improvements to which their attention has been
directed, was the building of an elegant stone bridge, in the
room of the old wooden one, over the <a name="page103"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 103</span>great river.&nbsp; This was done
about 1767, at the expence of nearly 2,300<i>l.</i>&nbsp; It
consists of one elliptical arch, very accurately
proportioned.&nbsp; A new Custom-House has been also erected; and
the streets are cleaned, lighted, and watched, at their
expence.&nbsp; Of late a new Jail and Shire-hall have been
likewise built; and when a few more improvements are made, and
especially the finishing of the circus, but few towns will be
more handsome than Wisbeach.&nbsp; The Theatre is a commodious
buildings in nearly a central situation.&nbsp; The Rose Inn,
where balls and monthly assemblies are held, is said to have been
a place of public reception from the year 1475, at which period
it was known by the sign of the Horn; and on one of the
out-buildings, erected in 1601, the figure of a horn is yet to be
seen.</p>
<p>The trade of Wisbeach is said to have much increased of late
years, through the improved state of the drainage and navigation
of the fens, and consequent augmentation of the produce and
consumption of the country: and it would, no doubt, have
increased much more, but for the bad state of the harbour or
river below.&nbsp; The average of the exports and imports amounts
to 40,000 tons annually.&nbsp; The principal articles of traffic
are coals, corn, timber, and wine.&nbsp; The neighbouring lands
are in high cultivation, chiefly on the grazing System.&nbsp; The
Sheep and oxen grow to a great size, and considerable numbers of
them are fattened, and sent twice every week to the London
market.&nbsp; The inhabitants are employed in commerce, there
being no manufacture <a name="page104"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 104</span>of any kind in the place, though the
surrounding country produces immense quantities of wool, hemp,
and flax.&nbsp; The market is abundantly supplied with poultry,
fish, and butchers meat; and the trade of the town is further
promoted by six small fairs, for hemp and flax, horned cattle and
horses.&nbsp; The canal, which was completed a few years ago,
extending from Wisbeach river to the river Nene at Outwell, and
thence to the river Ouse at Salters-Lode Sluice, opened a
communication with Norfolk, Suffolk, and other counties, and has
already benefited the town considerably. <a
name="citation104"></a><a href="#footnote104"
class="citation">[104]</a></p>
<p>The Summer Assizes, and the January and Midsummer quarter
sessions for the Isle of Ely, are held at Wisbeach; where the
magistrates assemble also every Wednesday and Saturday to settle
the assize of bread, and for other purposes.&nbsp; The chief
Justice of the Isle, and all other magistrates are appointed by
the bishop, who is here invested with temporal as well as
spiritual jurisdiction.&nbsp; The education of youth at Wisbeach
is provided for by a free school, and two charity schools,
supported by voluntary contributions.&nbsp; The appointment of
Master of the Free-School is vested in the Capital Burgesses,
with the consent of any other ten inhabitants, having voices in
the election of those Burgesses.&nbsp; It appears that the
Trinity Guild used to allow the Schoolmaster the annual salary of
10<i>l.</i> 6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> and that they also distributed
annually among the poor the sum of 3<i>l.</i> 15<i>s.</i> which
last sum, as Mr. Hutchesson assures <a name="page105"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 105</span>us, has been continued invariably to
this day.&nbsp; But 3<i>l.</i> 15<i>s.</i> is now a very paltry
sum, indeed, compared to what it was in the 15th and 16th
centuries.&nbsp; Its value now is scarcely a tenth part of what
it was then. <a name="citation105"></a><a href="#footnote105"
class="citation">[105]</a></p>
<p>An institution which has been justly deemed creditable to
Wisbeach, is its <i>Literary Society</i>, formed in 1781, whose
members sometime ago were about thirty, and its collection of
books, or library, consisted of upwards of a thousand
volumes.&mdash;Besides this institution, and some reading
societies, or book-clubs, Wisbeach can also boast of a
<i>Philosophical Society</i>, the President of which is <i>Mr.
Wm. Skrimshire Junr.</i> a gentleman much and deservedly
respected among his fellow-townsmen.&nbsp; He is allowed to be
well qualified for the presidentship of such an institution, from
his extensive knowledge of those subjects which it is the aim of
the Society chiefly to cultivate; and in some branches of natural
history he is said to be eminently conversant.&nbsp; He is a
native of the town, as well as one of the most ingenious,
intelligent, and respectable of its inhabitants.</p>
<p>Many remarkable personages may be supposed, one time and
another, to have appeared among the natives of Wisbeach; but we
shall here mention but two of them, and those of very unequal
merit.&mdash;One of them was <i>Dr. Henry Southwell</i>, late
rector of Asterby, and the reputed author of a well known and
popular Commentary on the Old and New Testament, commonly called
<a name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 106</span><i>Dr.
Southwell&rsquo;s Family Bible</i>; not a page of which, however,
was written by him, being absolutely unequal to such an
undertaking, and but a few degrees, if any, above an ideot. <a
name="citation106"></a><a href="#footnote106"
class="citation">[106]</a>&nbsp; But he sold his name to some
London booksellers for a certain pecuniary consideration, and
they employed one <i>Dr. Saunders</i>, a noted hackney writer, to
do the work.&nbsp; They also produced Letters of approbation and
recommendation, addressed to Dr. Southwell, from a great number
of pretended eminent clergymen, in different parts of the
kingdom.&nbsp; The trick succeeded, and the credulous public went
taken in, as usual.&nbsp; It was, certainly, a most shameful
business, and must be contemplated by all honest men with
abhorrence and indignation: but the work brought no small gain to
the publishers, for it had, it seems, a great run; and that, with
them, would sufficiently sanctify the imposture.&nbsp; It is to
be wished it could be said to be the only instance of the kind
that occurs in the transactions of modern booksellers.&nbsp; But
this is the age of imposition and humbugging, in which not only
booksellers, but even ministers of State have sometimes been too
fond of acting their parts.</p>
<p>The other person that shall be here named, as a native of
Wisbeach, is <i>Thomas Clarkson</i>.&nbsp; He too is a clergyman;
but of a character so very different from the former, that no two
human beings could well be more unlike each other.&nbsp; His
unparalleled exertions in behalf of the oppressed Africans, and
for the abolition of the detestable <i>Slave-trade</i>, so long
the disgrace and curse of this country, must place his name very
high indeed, <a name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
107</span>among the modern sons of Britain&mdash;even far above
our <i>Burkes</i>, our <i>Pitts</i>, and our <i>Nelsons</i>, as
the real friend of his country and his species, and the
benefactor of the human race.&nbsp; Compared with such
characters, he appears as an angel of light by the side of a
group of demons.&nbsp; The honour of giving birth to so estimable
and distinguished a person, must justly entitle the town of
Wisbeach to no small degree of lasting celebrity.&nbsp; He
should, certainly, be placed at the head of those memorable and
venerable instruments, who contributed to the abolishment and
annihilation of our most shameful, detestable, and horrid
traffick in human flesh and blood.&nbsp; But for his vigorous and
unwearied efforts, the names even of a <i>Fox</i> and a
<i>Wilberforce</i> had never perhaps been known, as the promoters
and champions of that honourable and sacred cause.&nbsp; But the
virtues he displayed, and the service he performed, on that never
to be forgotten occasion, are too well known, and too frequently
acknowledged, to need any eulogy that this feeble pen is capable
of attempting.&nbsp; Long may he live to enjoy his well-earned
fame, and to exhibit still more widely among his contemporaries,
by his future writings, the truth and importance of those exalted
principles, for which he so nobly and so successfully
contended.</p>
<p>The attention bestowed upon Wisbeach by <i>William</i> I, in
erecting there a stone castle, has been already noticed.&nbsp; To
some of our succeeding monarchs it also appears to have been an
object of partiality: we are accordingly informed that
<i>Richard</i> I, March 28th, 1190, granted the tenants of
Wisbeach-Barton Manor an exemption <a name="page108"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 108</span>or freedom from toll in all fairs
and markets throughout England.&nbsp; This grant was confirmed,
in 1214, by king <i>John</i>, who came to Wisbeach from Lynn in
October 1216, as Dr. Brady has proved from original records
preserved in the Tower.&nbsp; In the 12th of Henry IV. it was
renewed, and again confirmed by writ of privy seal of Henry
VI.&nbsp; Afterwards the privilege being forfeited, it was
restored through the exertions of <i>Nicholas Sandford</i>, who
died in 1608, and was buried in the church, where an inscription,
on the brass plate inserted in his tomb-stone, commemorates his
singular bounty and patriotism, as having, <i>at his own
charge</i>, <i>freed the town from toll</i>.</p>
<p>After Oliver Cromwell had been appointed governor of the Isle
of Ely, for his activity in swaying it to the interest of the
Parliament, he caused fortifications to be raised near the
Horse-shoe on the north side of Wisbeach, to secure the passes
out of Lincolnshire, which continued attached to the king.&nbsp;
The soldiers stationed to defend them were commanded by Colonel
Sir John Palgrave, and Captain William Dodson; and the
ammunition, and other warlike stores, were supplied from a Dutch
ship, which the Queen had dispatched from Holland for the use of
the royalists, but which, very seasonably and conveniently, fell
into the hands of their opponents.</p>
<p>In 1643 the burgesses lent 150<i>l.</i> to Captain Dodson, who
was then engaged in the siege of Croyland; and on the 25th of
March 1644, they delivered to Major John Ireton four muskets,
three bandeliers, and two swords, <a name="page109"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 109</span>for the service of the
Parliament.&nbsp; They also furnished the latter with a loan of
250<i>l.</i> towards raising a troop of horse for the defence of
the Isle.&nbsp; This troop seems to have been supported even
after the Revolution, as on the 6th of June, 1690, 4<i>l.</i>
were ordered to be paid towards the expence of a horse to serve
in &ldquo;the Troop,&rdquo; and the town-bailiff was directed to
defray a moiety of the charge for arms and furniture.</p>
<p>Between the restoration and the year 1672, cities, towns, and
even individuals, were allowed to coin copper money for the
convenience of trade: the Capital Burgesses of Wisbeach,
therefore, in February, 1670, ordered the town-bailiff to expend
20<i>l.</i> in coining halfpence, with the words &ldquo;A
Wisbeach Half-penny,&rdquo; on one side; and on the other, the
impression of the town-seal.&nbsp; In 1722, the poor-house was
erected, at the expence of 2000<i>l.</i> borrowed for that
purpose by the Capital Burgesses, on their corporation
seal:&mdash;for being an invisible body, (like other
bodies-corporate) whose intentions cannot be manifested or
expressed by personal acts, or oral discourse, they could act and
speak only by their common seal. <a name="citation109"></a><a
href="#footnote109" class="citation">[109]</a></p>
<p>The frequent journeys made by George II. to Hanover, (whither
it was supposed he transported a large share of the national
treasure,) and his attachment to Lady Kilmarnock, afterwards
Countess of Yarmouth, excited the displeasure of some of the
inhabitants of this town; and the Rev. <i>Thomas Whiston</i>,
curate to Dr. <a name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
110</span>Bell, preached a sermon full of asperity against the
King&rsquo;s conduct.&nbsp; His text was from Proverbs vii,
19&ndash;22.&nbsp; &ldquo;The good man is not at home, he is gone
a long journey, he hath taken a bag of money with him, and will
come home at the day appointed.&nbsp; With her much fair speech
she caused him to yield.&nbsp; He goeth after her straightway, as
an ox goeth to the slaughter, or as a fool to the correction of
the stocks.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Whiston seems to have been endued
with that talent which gives its possessor a facility in adapting
the language and circumstances of distant ages to the occurrences
of modern times; of which he gave further proof after the
suppression of the rebellion in 1745, and the return of the
Pretender into France, when he zealously defended the succession
of the House of Brunswick, taking for his text, 2 Kings, xix,
33.&nbsp; &ldquo;By the way that he came, by the same shall he
return, and shall not come into this city, saith the Lord.&rdquo;
<a name="citation110"></a><a href="#footnote110"
class="citation">[110]</a>&nbsp; One would suppose this clergyman
to have been in his day somewhat of an uncommon and singular,
though not apparently of a disreputable character.&nbsp; He was
evidently a patriot and anti-jacobite; and, unlike most of his
order, he could discern the errors and misdoings of the great,
and even testify against them in a very open and pointed
manner.&nbsp; On the prudence and propriety, or expediency of
this part of his conduct, different persons, no doubt, would
entertain different opinions.&nbsp; What he would have thought,
said, or done, had he lived in the present reign, and to this
very time, it is impossible to know.&nbsp; Of royal journeys <a
name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 111</span>to Hanover,
and of female favourites, or mistresses of the sovereign, one may
presume he would have seen no cause of complaint.&nbsp; But that
the same would have been the case, as to all our state maxims,
and public measures, and especially our three last wars, is more,
perhaps, than we are warranted to conclude; as it seems rather
probable, not to say more than probable, that Mr. Whiston would
have discovered in some, if not in all of them, no slight cause
of disgust and animadversion.&nbsp; How he would have stood
affected toward some of our princes of the blood, or royal dukes,
and what texts, or passages of scripture he would have applied to
them, or made the groundwork of sermons or addresses to his
parishioners concerning them, are questions that cannot now be
answered or resolved.</p>
<p>The river Nene, being navigable from Wisbeach to Peterborough,
and many other more distant inland parts, contributes much to the
commercial importance of the former.&nbsp; There are also
passage-boats on this river, which prove very convenient to
travellers, in their progress to, or from the great north
road.&mdash;Before we quit Wisbeach it may be here just hinted,
that some of its inhabitants have often been heard loudly
congratulating themselves, on the very superior advantages of
their town, compared with Lynn and most other boroughs, where the
corporation spirit is too apt to encroach and bear hard upon the
unprivileged part of the community; but which, happily, never
haunts, molests, or disturbs the people of Wisbeach.&nbsp; If
that be really the case, they <a name="page112"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 112</span>have, certainly, cause for boasting;
and we can do no less than hail them on the occasion.&mdash;The
population of Wisbeach, as ascertained by the late act, amounts
to near five thousand: so that it is the most populous town in
the county, except Cambridge.</p>

<p>Being here to quit Wisbeach, we shall now recross the ditch,
<a name="citation112"></a><a href="#footnote112"
class="citation">[112]</a> and take another turn in
Marshland.&nbsp; In this remarkable District, as has been already
intimated, scarce any edifices are to be seen, either of ancient
or modern date, that are worthy of very particular attention,
except the parish churches; and of them it does not seem
necessary to give here any further description: but it may be
just hinted, that next to Walpole St-Peter&rsquo;s, already
described, the two Terringtons, one of the Tilneys, West-Walton,
and Walsoken, are deemed the most considerable and
remarkable.&nbsp; Some account of them may be found in
Parkin&rsquo;s History of Freebridge Hundred and half.</p>
<p>In the same work may also be found a pretty distinct and
circumstantial account of the different manors in <a
name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 113</span>this
district, one of which belonged formerly to the Crown, as a royal
desmesne, and was repeatedly settled on some of our queen&rsquo;s
consorts, as part of their jointures.&mdash;It lies in
Terrington, and is called the bishop of Ely&rsquo;s manor, having
once belonged to his great lordship of West-Walton, Wisbeach,
&amp;c.&nbsp; It remained in the See of Ely till the death of
bishop <i>Cox</i>, in 1581, when it came to the Crown by an Act
of Parliament passed in the 4th of Elizabeth.&nbsp; James I.
granted it with all its appurtenances to his eldest son Henry,
and after his decease, to his other son Charles prince of Wales,
on whose marriage it was settled on his queen, as a part of her
jointure; from which, however, it has been thought not very
likely that she ever derived much benefit. <a
name="citation113"></a><a href="#footnote113"
class="citation">[113]</a>&nbsp; In the reign of Charles II. it
was again settled on Catherine of Lisbon, his consort, <a
name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 114</span>as part of
her dower or jointure, and was farmed by Sir James Chapman
Fuller, bart.&nbsp; In 1696, William Bentinck, earl of Portland,
had a grant of it from king William.&nbsp; Admiral Bentinck, a
descendant of that family, is the present possessor of it, and of
the greatest part of Terrington.&mdash;Somewhere upon this estate
of his, is said to be one of the best spots in the whole country
for forming a Decoy.&mdash;The Admiral, within these few years,
has added to his possessions here a large extent of salt marshes,
which he has rescued from the sea, and secured by strong and
capital embankments.&nbsp; No part of his valuable territory here
exceeds this newly recovered tract, in point of fertility: nor is
it exceeded, if equalled, by any other part of Marshland: and yet
it has been thought, from the high terms on which he lets it,
that he himself has overrated its value.&nbsp; This point,
however, must be left for him and his tenants to settle as they
can.</p>
<p>In Terrington is that Wash, or passage into Lincolnshire,
commonly called the <i>Cross Keys</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here (says
Parkin) is a guide always attending, to conduct passengers over,
bearing a wand or rod in his hand, probably in imitation of
Moses, who had a rod when he conducted the Israelites through the
Red Sea.&rdquo; <a name="citation114"></a><a href="#footnote114"
class="citation">[114]</a>&nbsp; A guide certainly does attend;
and it seems he bears a wand; but that he does so in imitation of
Moses, was, perhaps, never supposed by any one before Mr.
Parkin.&mdash;These guides might very probably use a wand, or
long rod, for the purpose of sounding the depth of the water, or
to discover any unevenness, dangerous holes, or sloughs at the
bottom.</p>
<p><a name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 115</span>The
Banks erected by the Romans to secure this country, appear to
have been well constructed (as was generally the case with the
great works of that people) and they served probably for ages as
effectual bulwarks against the encroachment of the ocean.&nbsp;
In a long course of time, however, they would naturally fall into
decay; and the Saxons, who succeeded the Romans, being never very
remarkable for their attention to such matters, or their skill in
the management of them, it is not to be wondered that we often
hear in aftertimes of breaches in the banks; and of high tides,
or great inland floods deluging and desolating the country.</p>
<p>As long ago as the reign of Edward I. we read of certain
lawless people making breaches in the banks, and resisting those
who would have stopt them; upon which the king is said to have
appointed certain persons to inquire into those misdemeanours,
and punish the offenders.&nbsp; Afterward, in the same reign,
mischievous persons are said to have thrown down the bank at
<i>Little-lode</i>; when a new commission was issued to search
after the offenders and bring them to justice.&nbsp; Another
commission was issued some few years after, when Robert Russel,
bailiff to the Abbot of Ramsey, John Mayner, Walter Halleman and
others, were found out as offenders, having by force of arms,
broke down the Dam at <i>Smalelode</i>, and Richard Curteys the
other at <i>Wadynstowe</i>; and the Sheriff was ordered to
apprehend them.&nbsp; All this seems very plainly to indicate,
that, even in the reign of our boasted <i>English Justinian</i>,
the state of things in this country was very different from what
it was in that of <a name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
116</span>the immortal <i>Alfred</i>. <a
name="citation116"></a><a href="#footnote116"
class="citation">[116]</a>&nbsp; In the 22, of Henry VIII. an act
passed, making it felony to demolish the sea banks, which seems
to have put an effectual stop to those flagitious
proceedings.</p>
<p>Among the shocking inundations, from which this low country
greatly suffered in former times, the following seem to be the
most remarkable.&mdash;In the year 1236, on the morrow after
Martinmas-day, and the eight following days, the sea, by the
violence of the wind, was raised to such a height, that the
banks, yielding to the force of the water, were broken so, that
&ldquo;of small craft, cattle, and men,&rdquo; great multitudes
were destroyed.&nbsp; A similar calamity happened about nineteen
years afterward.&nbsp; Also in 1437, by a breach in the bank of
Wisbeach Fen, 4,400 acres of land were overflowed.&nbsp; Another
of those disastrous events happened on Monday and Tuesday, the
second and third of October, 1570, by which all Marshland
together with the town of Wigenhale, were overflowed with salt
water; so that from Old Lynn to Magdalen-bridge there were not
left ten roods of the bank whole and firm, to the very great
damage of the whole country.&nbsp; How or when that damage was
repaired, or the banks restored to their former state, does not
appear; but in the 39th of the same reign (that of Elizabeth)
complaint was made at a Session of Sewers, that through neglect
<a name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 117</span>of
keeping the water in at Rightforth Lode within the crests of the
same, the grounds on the north side of the said Lode were, in
time of great inundations, overflown, which occasioned the
tenants, for avoiding the water, to cut the old Powdike, and
issue the said water into Marshland Fen, to the great loss of the
inhabitants and commoners there.&nbsp; It was therefore ordained
and decreed, by the commissioners, that whoever should so
transgress in future, should be fined 20<i>l.</i> for every such
default.</p>
<p>After this, on the 1st of April 1607 (5. Jac.) there happened
a mighty tide, which broke Catt&rsquo;s bank, and drowned
Clenchwarton.&nbsp; About 1610, provision was made for draining
the waters of Oldfield, Outwell, &amp;c. without issuing them
through Broken Dike into Marshland, and also for a general repair
of all the banks.&nbsp; How far these measures were carried on,
or effected, cannot now be said; but they proved entirely
ineffectual to secure the country from that dreadful inundation
of the sea, which happened on November 1, 1613 (11 Jac.) and
which laid all Marshland and parts adjacent under water, and
proved exceedingly calamitous to the whole country.&nbsp; In
commemoration of this most disastrous event, the following rather
quaint Inscription was set up on the East Wall of the south aisle
in Wisbeach Church&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;To the immortal praise of God Almighty,
that saveth his people in all adversities, be it kept in
perpetual memory, That on the Feast-Day of <i>All saints</i>,
being the first of November in the year of our Lord 1613, late in
the night, the sea broke in through <a name="page118"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 118</span>the violence of a North East wind,
meeting with a Spring Tide, and overflowed all <i>Marshland</i>,
with the town of <i>Wisbeche</i>, both on the north side and on
the south; and almost the whole Hundred round about; to the great
danger of men&rsquo;s lives, and the losse of some; besides the
exceeding great lossc which these counties sustained through the
breach of the banks, and spoil of corn, cattle, and housing,
which could not be estimated.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dugdale in his History of Embanking has preserved&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;An Abstract of the losses in general
(sustained on the above occasion) as they were presented by the
Jurors of several Hundreds at the Session of Sewers held at Lynn,
December 9, 1613.&mdash;<i>Within</i> the Ring of Marshland the
statement of the said losses is as
follows&mdash;<i>Terrington</i>, 10,416<i>l</i>; <i>Walpole</i>,
3,000<i>l</i>; <i>West-Walton</i>, 850<i>l</i>; <i>Walsoken</i>,
1,328<i>l</i>; <i>Emneth</i>, 150<i>l</i>; <i>Wigenhale</i> and
<i>South Lynn</i>, 6,000<i>l</i>; <i>Tilney</i> and
<i>Islington</i>, 4,380<i>l</i>; <i>Clenchwarton</i>,
6,000<i>l</i>; <i>West</i> and <i>North Lynn</i>,
4,000<i>l</i>&mdash;in all 35,834<i>l</i>.&mdash;<i>Without</i>
the Ring of Marshland, the damage was far less considerable, and
is given as follows, <i>Gaywood</i>, 205<i>l</i>; <i>South
Wotton</i>, 313<i>l</i>; <i>North Wotton</i>, 810<i>l</i>;
<i>Watlington</i>, 500<i>l</i>; <i>Totnel</i> cum
<i>Wormegay</i>, 60<i>l</i>; <i>Holm</i> cum <i>Thorpland</i>,
40<i>l</i>; <i>Stow Bardolf</i>, 100<i>l</i>: in all
2,028<i>l</i>; which added to the former account will amount to
no less a sum than 37,862<i>l</i>.&rdquo;&mdash;A sum equal,
perhaps, to near half a million of our money.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The damages at or about Wisbeach, and <i>out of Norfolk</i>,
are not included in the above abstract; though they must,
doubtless, have been very considerable, and probably <a
name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 119</span>not much
less than the former: the whole together must, of course, have
been enormous, and equal to many hundred thousand pounds of our
money.</p>
<p>In the months of January and February, and particularly on the
23rd of March in the ensuing year (1614,) the country sustained
much additional damage from the snows that had fallen, and which
had occasioned vast floods from the upland countries upon their
going off.&nbsp; A great part of Marshland, from the bank called
the Edge, between the towns and Emneth, to the New Podike, was
overflowed with fresh water, by divers breaches, between
Salter&rsquo;s Lode and Downham Bridge.&nbsp; The country to the
south of Wisbeach also suffered greatly on the occasion; as did
likewise the greater part of the land within South Eaubrink in
Holland, which was so overflowed and damaged, from Spalding to
Tydd St. Giles, as to be almost entirely lost for that
year.&mdash;From these premises it evidently appears, that the
boasted fertility, and numerous advantages of Marshland and the
adjacent parts have often been woefully counterbalanced by
disadvantages and evils of a most serious and distressing nature;
so as to leave the inhabitants but very little room to exult over
their less wealthy countrymen, whose lot is fallen in the more
sterile and rugged parts of the kingdom.</p>
<p>Before we finish this Section, it may be proper to say
something of the principal divisions of Marshland, and its
extent, which we often find differently represented.&nbsp; In its
fullest extent, or <i>within its ring</i>, as it is sometimes <a
name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 120</span>expressed,
Marshland comprehends the following parishes, (with the exception
of part of that of St. German&rsquo;s, which lies on the eastern

Wigenhale St. Mary Magdalen.&mdash;In another view, as a
privileged district, and, particularly, as interested in the
<i>Smeeth</i>, Marshland has been considered as much less
extensive, comprehending only eleven parishes, or rather confined
to <i>seven towns</i>, or townships: and then N. and W. Lynn,
with the three Wigenhales are excluded.&nbsp; These townships; or
the seven towns of Marshland, as they are usually called, are
thus enumerated&mdash;1. Emneth.&nbsp; 2. Walsoken.&nbsp; 3. West
Walton.&nbsp; 4. The two Walpoles, both under one.&nbsp; 5. The
two Terringtons, both under one.&nbsp; 6. Clenchwarton.&nbsp; 7.
The two Tilneys and Islington, all under one, or constituting one
township.&mdash;At what time this division of the district into
seven townships took place, does not appear.&nbsp; It was,
probably, at a remote period, and before the formation of the
eleven parishes, which these townships now contain.&nbsp; It may,
perhaps not unreasonably be presumed to have originated under the
East-Anglian government, at an early period of the
Heptarchy:&mdash;if not, indeed, even before either the
Heptarchy, or yet the East-Anglian government had ever sprung
into existence.</p>

<p class="gutsumm"><i>Biographical Sketches of some of the most
distinguished personages of other times</i>, <i>in Marshland and
its vicinity</i>.</p>
<p>Of celebrated characters, or men who attained to high renown
among their contemporaries, but a very moderate number appears to
belong to Marshland or its vicinity.&nbsp; Some such, however,
seem to have sprung up there, at different periods, within the
last thousand years: and of them, whose names have been
preserved, the first place, at least in point of seniority, seems
to belong to</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Hickifric</span>, vulgarly called
<i>Tom Hickatrif</i> or <i>Hickathrift</i>.&nbsp; He is supposed
to have lived some time before the conquest, and to have been in
his day and generation,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A village Hampden, that with dauntless
breast<br />
The little tyrants of his fields withstood.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He has been represented as the proprietor of the
<i>Smeeth</i>; though he might, perhaps, be only entitled to the
benefit of pasturage there, in common with the rest of his
neighbours.&nbsp; Be that as it might, it is agreed on all hands
that he was a person of uncommon strength, gigantic stature, and
unshaken fortitude.&nbsp; Very different from most other men of
might, it does not appear that he was ever accused of oppressing
his weaker neighbours, insulting their persons, or committing
depredations upon their property.&nbsp; His superior powers and
valour were called forth and employed only in defence of his own
just right and property, and those of his oppressed
fellow-citizens.&nbsp; Tradition informs us of a <a
name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 122</span>certain
unwarrantable and base attempt being once made, by some lawless
and powerful men, to encroach upon the neighbouring inhabitants,
and dispossess them of their right to the <i>Smeeth</i>; or, at
least, to deprive them of some part of that fertile tract; and
which was to be effected by force of arms, as the inhabitants
seemed determined to make resistance, and not tamely to part
with, or give up their rights.&nbsp; An engagement accordingly
ensued, which terminated in the total discomfiture of the
invaders, and the consequent reinstatement of the inhabitants in
the quiet possession of their wonted privileges.&nbsp; The
victory was universally ascribed to the singular prowess and
irresistible exertions of Hickifric, who fought that day, as the
tradition says, with a cart-wheel in one hand, instead of a
buckler or shield, and an axletree in the other, instead of a
spear or battle-ax.&nbsp; In short he is said to have acquitted
himself on that memorable occasion, so as to establish his
character, and hand it down to posterity, as, at once, the firm
patriot, and redoubtable champion.&nbsp; A stone coffin, in
Tilney churchyard, is shewn to this day as having once belonged
to him.&nbsp; But this, perhaps, may be questioned, as may also
some of the circumstances of the above story, though the
substance of it may be true: the affair of the <i>wheel</i> and
<i>axletree</i>, for instance, like many other vulgar traditions,
may be only hyperbolically and not literally true; and implying
no more than, that be furnished himself for the said conflict
with certain rustic, ponderous and unusual weapons; which blind
tradition and stupid credulity afterwards converted into a
cartwheel and an axletree.</p>
<p><a name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
123</span>2.&nbsp; <i>Saint</i> <span
class="smcap">Godric</span>.&nbsp; He is said to have been a
native of <i>Walpole</i>, and to have originally followed the
humble occupation or profession of a <i>Pedler</i>.&nbsp; He
afterwards went on pilgrimage to Rome, and even to Jerusalem; but
whether he relinquished his former profession before he set off,
or took his pedlery along with him, does not appear.&nbsp; Some
of the pilgrims of those times, it is said, used to engage,
clandestinely, in certain pedling, mercantile, or commercial
adventures, and to find their account in so doing, as the garb,
or profession of pilgrims exempted them from the tolls or duties
imposed upon mere pedlers, or merchants.&nbsp; Whether that was
the case with our Godric, or not, he acquired the character of a
<i>Saint</i>, and was <i>canonized</i>; which yet with some
people will make no very great deal in his favour.&nbsp; In the
latter part of his life he became a <i>hermit</i>, and lived
sometime at <i>Finchale</i> near Durham, where he is said to have
worn out no less than three successive suits of <i>iron</i>
clothes, <a name="citation123"></a><a href="#footnote123"
class="citation">[123]</a> which, with many, would be an
indubitable proof that his sanctity must have been far superior
to that of the wearers of <i>flannel</i>, <i>coarse woollen</i>,
or even <i>haircloth</i>; by which kind of dresses numbers of his
brethren chose to distinguish themselves.&nbsp; Godric died in
1170.&nbsp; Many miracles, of course, are ascribed to him; and
his <i>girdle</i> that he left, was said to have in it such
uncommon and wonderful virtue, as to make barren women
fruitful.&mdash;After all, it seems not quite clear, or certain,
that he was a better man, or worthier character than
Hickifric.</p>
<p><a name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
124</span>3.&nbsp; <i>Sir</i> <span class="smcap">Frederic
Tilney</span>.&nbsp; He was one of the attendants and Captains of
<i>Richard</i> I, in his memorable expedition to the Holy Land,
and was knighted by that monarch, in his third year, at
<i>Acon</i> or <i>Acre</i>, otherwise Ptolemais&mdash;[a place
rendered very famous during the Crusades; especially by the
heroic achievements of the lion-hearted Richard and his
followers; and no less so of late years, by its obstinate and
successful defence against the arms and repeated assaults of
Bonaparte.]&mdash;Sir Frederic Tilney was distinguished for his
great stature and vast bodily strength; being, perhaps, a
descendant of Hickifric.&nbsp; He survived the expedition to
Palestine, and returned safe to his native country, where he
ended his days in peace, and was buried with his ancestors at
Terrington, <i>by Tilney</i>; that is, at <i>St.
John&rsquo;s</i>, as it is supposed; where we are told his height
was to be seen as late as 1556.&mdash;Sixteen knights of the same
name (and supposed to be his descendants) succeeded him, most, if
not all of whom lived at Boston.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Richard de
Tyrington</span>.&nbsp; He is said to have been one of the great
favourites of <i>King John</i>, who granted him, for his life, an
annuity of twenty marks.&nbsp; Little more is known of him.&nbsp;
But as a king&rsquo;s favourite, he must have been a noted man in
his day.&nbsp; That king had many favourites, it seems, in and
about Lynn.&nbsp; No part of his kingdom seemed to be more, if so
much attached to him.&nbsp; His favourites and adherents, and
this Richard of Terrington among the rest, may be presumed to be
much of the same cast with their royal, patron, and therefore the
less said about them is best.</p>
<p><a name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
125</span>5.&nbsp; <i>Sir</i> <span class="smcap">Frederick
Chervill</span>, or <i>Chervile</i>, otherwise
<i>Kervile</i>.&nbsp; He lived in the reign of Henry III. and had
considerable possessions in Tilney, Islington, Wigenhale, and
Clenchwarton.&nbsp; He was found, in the thirty-fourth year of
that king, to have a <i>Gallows</i> in Tilney, and the liberty or
power of trying and hanging offenders; by which it appears, that
he was in his time a person of no small consequence and dignity
in this country.&nbsp; He lived at the time when the Ouse
deserted its ancient course or channel by Wisbeach, and mixed
with the waters of Wigenhale and of Lynn.&nbsp; Of the qualities
of his heart, or his particular deeds, good or bad, no memorial
now remains.&mdash;The seat of the Kerviles, for many successive
generations, was the manor-house of Wigenhale St. Mary&rsquo;s,
of which only the gate-house now remains, and is visible from the
Wisbeach road.&nbsp; Its appearance seems to indicate that the
mansion formerly attached to it was in its day a sumptuous
edifice; and for no short period, perhaps, the first house in all
Marshland.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">John Colton</span>: a native of
Terrington, chaplain to <i>W. Bateman</i>, bishop of Norwich, and
the first master of <i>Gonvil-Hall</i> in Cambridge.&nbsp;
Afterward, on account of his great learning and piety, (as it is
said) Henry IV. advanced him to the archbishopric of Armagh, and
primacy of Ireland.&nbsp; While in that high station he was sent
to Rome, and employed in the affair of the schism between Urban
VI. and Clement VII. which occasioned his writing a learned
treatise (as Fuller says) <i>De causa Schismatis</i>; and also
another <i>De remedio </i><a name="page126"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 126</span><i>ejusd</i>.&nbsp; He is supposed
to have resigned his archbishopric some time before his death,
which happened, it seems, in 1404.&nbsp; It does not appear that
he was one of the worst men of his order.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Walter Tirrington</span>, LL.D. a
celebrated writer and author, is said to have been another native
of Terrington.&nbsp; At what time he flourished, is rather
uncertain; though it seems not improbable, that he was
contemporary with <i>Colton</i>.&nbsp; Nor is it now known what
these writings were which made him so celebrated as an
author.&nbsp; Whatever they were, and they might be highly
valuable in their time, they seem to have been long ago swallowed
up in the dark devouring abyss or gulph of oblivion; and from
which the very name of their author has hardly escaped.</p>
<p>8.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">John Aylmer</span>: born at
Aylmer-Hall in Tilney, about 1521.&nbsp; When very young, Henry
Grey, Marquis of Dorset, afterward Duke of Suffolk, took a great
liking to him, entertained him as his scholar, and gave him an
exhibition at Cambridge, where his proficiency was so
considerable, that he was afterward deemed one of the best
scholars of his time. <a name="citation126"></a><a
href="#footnote126" class="citation">[126]</a>&nbsp; From the
University his noble patron took him to his family, and made him
tutor to his children, among whom was the memorable <i>Lady Jane
Grey</i>.&nbsp; He early imbibed the opinion of the reformers,
and was very instrumental, under the patronage of the Duke of
Suffolk, and the Earl of Huntingdon, in diffusing the same about
Leicestershire, (in which <a name="page127"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 127</span>bounty was the Duke&rsquo;s chief
seat and residence,) where he seems to have had some preferment,
and to have been tor sometime the only preacher of that
description.&nbsp; In time he was promoted to the archdeaconry of
<i>Stow</i>, in the diocese of Lincoln, which qualified him to
sit in Convocation, the first year of the reign of Mary, where he
defended protestantism with so much zeal, learning, and
acuteness, that he was soon after deprived of his archdeaconry,
and obliged to abscond and quit the kingdom, to avoid the
approaching storm.&nbsp; After he had embarked he was in no small
danger from the searchers, who came onboard, in quest of
fugitives; but he happily escaped, partly through his own
diminutive size, (being of small stature like <i>Zaccheus</i>,)
and partly through the friendship of the Captain, who placed him
in the empty end of a wine <i>butt</i>, that had a partition in
the middle, where he sat very snugly, while the searchers were
drinking wine, which they saw drawn out of the other end.&nbsp;
He was sometime after landed on the continent, and got safe to
Strasburgh, whence he shortly after removed to Zurich, where he
diligently prosecuted his studies, and attended the Lectures of
Peter Martyr.&nbsp; He afterwards visited most of the
universities of Italy and Germany, and at <i>Jena</i>, in Saxony,
he had the offer of the Hebrew Professorship, which he
declined.&nbsp; After the accession of Elizabeth he returned
home, and was one of the divines appointed to dispute at
Westminster with an equal number of popish bishops.&nbsp; He
sometime after was made archdeacon of Lincoln; but got no higher
for a long while.&nbsp; At last, upon the <a
name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 128</span>translation
of Sandys to York, he was appointed his successor in the see of
London.&nbsp; This elevation he is said to have owed, in a great
measure, to the interest and friendship of that prelate, but
which he afterward very ill requited.&nbsp; He now forgot his
former affection to the puritans, and became a bitter
persecutor.&nbsp; On Sunday afternoons he was fond of playing at
bowls, and would use such language at this game as justly exposed
him to reproach.&nbsp; When he happened to preach, if he observed
his audience inattentive, he would take a Hebrew bible out of his
pocket, and read them a few verses, and then resume his
discourse. <a name="citation128a"></a><a href="#footnote128a"
class="citation">[128a]</a>&nbsp; He was a man of great courage,
which he shewed on many occasions; one of which was his having a
tooth drawn, to encourage the queen to submit to the like
operation.&nbsp; <i>Strype</i> says, he was a man of metal, and
could use his hands and arms well, <a name="citation128b"></a><a
href="#footnote128b" class="citation">[128b]</a> and would turn
his back on no man.&nbsp; <i>Fuller</i> says, he was foully
belibelled by the puritans; but does not say how much provocation
he had given them <a name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
129</span>for so doing.&nbsp; He died at his Palace of Fulham,
June 3. 1594.</p>
<p>9.&nbsp; <i>Sir</i> <span class="smcap">Robert Aylmer</span>,
elder brother of the preceding, appears to have been a person of
some note in his time, and resided chiefly, as it is supposed, at
Aylmer Hall, above-mentioned; but as the particulars of his
history have not been recorded, and seem to be now entirely
forgotten, no more can be here said of him.</p>
<p>10.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Thomas Herring</span>.&nbsp; He
was the Son of the reverend <i>John Herring</i>, rector of
Walsoken, where he was born in 1693.&nbsp; At a proper time he
was sent to Cambridge, and in 1722, became chaplain to Dr.
Fleetwood, bishop of Ely.&nbsp; In 1726 he was chosen preacher of
Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn, and appointed king&rsquo;s chaplain; in 1737
he was made bishop of Bangor, and in 1743 was translated to
York.&nbsp; When the rebellion broke out, and the king&rsquo;s
troops were defeated at Preston Pans, the archbishop convened the
nobility, gentry, and clergy of his diocese, and by an excellent
speech removed the general panic, and excited such zeal among his
auditors, that a subscription to the amount of 40,000<i>l.</i>
was raised; and the example was followed in most parts of the
kingdom.&nbsp; On the death of Dr. <i>Potter</i>, in 1747, he was
advanced to Canterbury, and so attained to the very summit of
ecclesiastical preferment and dignity; but his health very soon
began to impair, and after languishing about four years, he died,
in 1757, leaving behind him a very amiable and excellent
character, in spite of the many disadvantages of his elevated
situation, <a name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
130</span>and his long course of worldly prosperity.&nbsp; He
appears to have been a real and warm friend to civil and
religious liberty, as well as one of the best and worthiest men
of the age in which he lived.</p>
<p>11.&nbsp; Dr. <span class="smcap">Richard Busby</span>.&nbsp;
He was not indeed born in Marshland, but close by, at Lutton in
Lincolnshire, in 1606.&nbsp; He had his education at Westminster
school, and afterward at Christ-Church, in Oxford.&nbsp; In 1640,
he was appointed master of Westminster school, and by his skill
and diligence in that laborious and important office, for the
space of fifty five years, bred up the greatest number of eminent
men, in church and state that any teacher or tutor could boast of
in this, or perhaps in any other country.&nbsp; In his school
discipline, he was extremely and proverbially severe, though he
applauded and rewarded wit in his scholars, even when it
reflected on himself.&nbsp; After a long life of unwearied
assiduity and temperance, he died, in 1695, at the age of 89.</p>
<p>Here it may not be improper to add, that the noble families of
the <i>Howards</i> and the <i>Walpoles</i> appear to have
originated in Marshland.&mdash;The ancestors of the former,
sometime after the conquest, bore the name of <i>Wigenhale</i>,
or <i>de Wigenhale</i>, from that being their place of residence,
and where they had their most considerable possessions.&nbsp; In
the 12th century lived a notable person of this family, whose
name was Sir William de Wigenhale, and who, it seems, went
sometimes under the name of William de Clenchwarton, from his
having large possessions in that parish.&nbsp; John, the Son of
this William, in the 13th century, <a name="page131"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 131</span>took the surname of <i>Howard</i>,
(on what account does not appear,) and his descendants have borne
that name ever since.&nbsp; William, the son of this John Howard,
became one of the most eminent lawyers and distinguished
characters of his time, being Lord Chief Justice of England, in
the reign of Edward I. and one of that King&rsquo;s privy
Council.&nbsp; He owned the manor of East Winch, and the
manor-house there appears to have been his principal seat, and
where the family chiefly resided for some generations.&nbsp; In
the chapel of St. Mary&rsquo;s, on the south side of East Winch
church, supposed to have been built by him, he and many of his
earlier descendants are said to have been buried.&nbsp; The
Howard family continued to reside at East Winch till towards the
close of the 14th Century, and perhaps longer.&nbsp; Sir
William&rsquo;s great grandson, Sir Robert Howard, lived there,
and there, it seems, he died and was buried, in 1388.&mdash;Sir
William Howard rendered much good service, of some sort, to the
corporation of Lynn, of which that body was not insensible, as
appears by divers presents, which he and his lady received in
return;&mdash;such as the carcase of an ox, one time, to lady
Howard, which, with the conveying of it to Winch, cost <i>eleven
shillings</i>, a sum equal, no doubt, to many pounds of our
money.&nbsp; Another time a present of wine, together with two
calves, and a collar, or shield of brawn, were sent as a present
to Sir William, and valued at <i>thirteen shillings</i>.&nbsp;
Another time, two salmons were sent to Sir William, on the vigil
of Easter, valued at <i>eleven shillings</i>; <a
name="citation131"></a><a href="#footnote131"
class="citation">[131]</a> which, compared with the value of the
other articles, <a name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
132</span>seems to indicate, that salmon was a very great rarity
at that period.&mdash;Such was the origin of the far-famed House
of Howard, which has been long since divided into so many noble
branches, and makes so conspicuous a figure in the British
Annals, and whose chief is now, and has long been the first peer
of the realm.</p>
<p>As to the <i>Walpole family</i>, it appears to be no less
ancient than that of the Howards, although it did not rise so
soon to very great eminence.&nbsp; Like the Howards, or rather
the <i>Wigenhales</i>, it first appeared among the opulent
Marshland families, not long after the conquest; but whether
either of these families is of Saxon, Danish, or Norman descent,
does not appear.&nbsp; The Walpole family took its name from the
town of Walpole in Marshland, where the forefathers of the family
resided, and had large possessions.&nbsp; Reginald de Walpole,
who lived in the reign of Henry I. is thought the lineal ancestor
of the present family.&nbsp; His son, Richard de Walpole, married
Emma the daughter of Walter de Havelton (or de Houghton) of
Houghton, in Norfolk.&nbsp; From that time, the family, or the
principal branch of it, fixed its residence at Houghton, where it
has continued almost ever since.&nbsp; Sir John Walpole, knight,
was a favourite of Henry III. whom he accompanied in his
expedition to Britany.&nbsp; His son, Sir Henry de Walpole, was a
Judge, about the 50th year of the same king&rsquo;s reign.&nbsp;
Another of the family, Ralph de Walpole, was about the same time
bishop of Ely, and afterward of Norwich. <a
name="citation132"></a><a href="#footnote132"
class="citation">[132]</a>&nbsp; Some of the family, at different
<a name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 133</span>times,
long after the removal of one branch to Houghton, appear to
reside at Walpole; and in the reign of Henry VII. we find the
owner of Houghton residing at Lynn, as appears by his Will, where
he is called Thomas Walpole, Esquire, of Lynne Bishop.&nbsp; In
that Will, among other things, he leaves certain lands and
tenements at Walpole, &ldquo;to the brodirhode of the Holy
Trinity at Lynne Bishop, to the intent the Alderman and Skyvens
of the said Gylde shall find and pay yerly eight marks to the
wages of an abil prest to synge mess perpetually for his sowl,
and the sowl of Jone his wife, in the chapel of our Lady, in the
chapel of St. Nicholas in Lynne.&rdquo;&mdash;For many ages the
Walpoles made no mean figure among the Norfolk gentry; but none
of them appear to have been advanced to the peerage till the
eighteenth century; since which time, they have ranked among the
principal nobility of the kingdom.&nbsp; But of the whole race,
from first to last, the most distinguished and memorable
character was the famous Sir Robert Walpole, prime minister to
our two first sovereigns, of the present dynasty, and afterward
created Earl of Orford; of whom some account will be given in the
next chapter, section IV.</p>
<p>Here it may be added, that the family of the <i>Coneys</i> has
also, for some ages, figured among the principal inhabitants of
Marshland.&nbsp; They seem however, to have been originally of
Lynn, and to have ranked, at a pretty distant period, among the
principal people of that town.&nbsp; Some of their modern
descendants are said to have prided themselves, not a little, on
the score of <a name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
134</span>their remote ancestry, but as the remarkable, or
memorable part of the history of those remote ancestors of the
family, or even the very names of more than one of them, <a
name="citation134"></a><a href="#footnote134"
class="citation">[134]</a> have not yet come to the knowledge of
the present writer; it cannot be expected that he should say any
more here about them.&mdash;The pride of ancestry, or the plea of
being descended from renowned progenitors, is often very idle and
childish, especially when none of the eminent or estimable traits
which distinguished and characterized those progenitors are
discoverable in their descendants.</p>

<p class="gutsumm">Of the parts about Lynn, on the eastern side

<p class="gutsumm"><i>Aspect of the country&mdash;its agriculture
and rural economy&mdash;Wayland Wood&mdash;Memoir of
Shuckforth&mdash;parish churches and other edifices</i>,
<i>ancient and modern</i>.</p>
<p>After passing from Marshland to the eastern side of the Ouse,
the country presently begins to exhibit a very different
appearance.&nbsp; The surface now ceases to be flat and even as
before, and the very soil appears considerably altered and
diversified.&nbsp; A light sandy soil soon presents itself, and
the land becomes higher and comparatively hilly, as well as in
general much less fertile and productive than in Marshland.&nbsp;
The style, or mode and process of agriculture also differs
considerably, as do likewise even the very implements of
husbandry.&nbsp; There are certainly some slovenly farmers on
this eastern side, but there are many others who manage their
farms in a manner greatly superior to what is generally done on
the other side of the river.&nbsp; Indeed the comparative
poorness of the soil here may operate <a name="page136"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 136</span>in no small degree as a spur to
superior exertion and improvement.&nbsp; Where the land is poor
nature requires the greater attention and assistance; and without
skilful, laborious, and expensive management the cultivator
cannot expect to thrive.&nbsp; Those farmers who have
distinguished themselves, by a close attention to the pursuit of
wise projects of agricultural improvement, have found their
account abundantly in so doing.&nbsp; They have generally
attained to considerable opulence, so as to be able to exhibit
the appearance of wealthy independent country gentleman, instead
of a servile, cringing yeomanry or tenantry.&nbsp; Not a few of
them are supposed to live as well as their landlords: but the
conduct of some of them towards the <i>poor</i> has been thought
cruel and tyrannical.</p>
<p>Dairies are said to be here rather neglected, and the
farmers&rsquo; attention chiefly directed to tillage and the
growing of corn.&nbsp; The <i>cheese</i> is for the most part
very ordinary and poor, and the <i>butter</i> not
excellent.&mdash;No part of England exceeds Norfolk, or even
equals it, in the culture of <i>turnips</i>, for which its loose,
light, and sandy soil is thought to be very favourable.&nbsp;
Much dependence is here placed on the turnip crop, for subsisting
the sheep and cattle during the winter season; and if it fail, or
is materially injured by early frosts, or other means, the
complaints become loud, and the consequences often prove serious
and distressing.</p>
<p>The turnip was only cultivated in gardens, as a culinary plant
in this country till the reign of George I. when Lord Townshend,
an ancestor of the present marquis, who had attended the king to
Hanover, as secretary <a name="page137"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 137</span>of state, observing the profit and
utility of the field cultivation of turnips in that electorate,
on his return brought with him the seed and recommended it to his
tenants who occupied land of a similar quality to that of
Hanover.&nbsp; The experiment succeeded adequate to expectation:
the practice gradually spread over the county, and made its way
into other parts of the kingdom.&nbsp; This important root, the
great source of abundance to the county, has been gradually
rising to its present state, for upwards of seventy years&mdash;A
good acre of turnips in Norfolk will produce between thirty and
forty cart-loads, as heavy as three horses can draw; and an acre
will fat a Scotch bullock from forty to fifty stone, or eight
sheep.&nbsp; But the advantage of this crop does not end here,
for it generally leaves the land so clean and in such fine
condition, that it almost insures a good crop of barley, and a
kind plant of clover; and the clover is a most excellent
preparative for wheat, so that in the subsequent advantages the
value of the turnip can hardly be estimated.&nbsp; It has however
been observed, that the cultivation of this root has reached its
acme; and that at present, from some latent causes, it is on the
decline: for recently more seed is become necessary, and the crop
is said to be more precarious.&nbsp; Some have attributed it to
the want of deeper ploughing, and instances have been adduced of
the extraordinary depth to which turnips, and even <i>wheat</i>
will radicate.&nbsp; This however has been thought insufficient
to affix the cause of failure to shallow ploughing. <a

<p><a name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 138</span>Among
our enlightened agriculturists the first place in generally
allotted to those of Norfolk; and it has been observed, that the
first thing that attracts the eye of a stranger here, is the fine
<i>tilth</i> of the soil, and the <i>succession</i> of
crops.&nbsp; The mode of cultivating the arable lands is worthy,
no doubt, of imitation, wherever it can be adopted.&nbsp; The
plough, which is of an admirable construction, is drawn by two
horses harnessed abreast, which with a pair of reins are guided
by the person who holds the plough.&nbsp; Instead of working the
animals seven or eight hours without drawing bit, as is the
custom in some counties, they are here worked eight hours in
winter, and ten in Summer, by two journeys, as they are termed,
which enables them to do considerably more than they would by one
journey.&nbsp; The ploughings are repeated till the land is high
in tilth, when it is completely pulverized with <i>wheeled</i>
drags and harrows, which are violently drawn by the horses being
kept upon a <i>trotting</i> pace.&nbsp; Owing to this rapid
movement, the clods are very effectually broken, and the land
well prepared to receive the seed.&nbsp; After this is sown or
planted, the utmost attention is paid to keep the land free from
weeds.&nbsp; The ridiculous custom of letting the land lie
<i>idle</i> one year in every three, for the advantage of what is
termed <i>fallowing</i>, is here properly exploded.&nbsp; The
necessity of it has been superceded, and the reasons of it done
away, by a judicious course of <i>cropping</i>; so that one crop
may fertilise as the other exhausts; and in this manner are the
lands cultivated like gardens, yielding various crops in
perpetual succession, to the mutual benefit of the landlord and
tenant; and of general utility to the public.</p>
<p><a name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 139</span>The
mode of cropping in general practice is what is termed a
<i>sixcourse shift</i>&mdash;the first year wheat; second,
barley, with or without clover; third, turnips; fourth, barley or
oates, with or without clover; fifth, clover mown for hay; sixth,
grazed and ploughed up for wheat again.&nbsp; Some vary this mode
by a five or a four course shift.&nbsp; Wheat is a general crop
over the whole county, but thrives best on the stiff loamy
lands.&nbsp; The lighter soils are favourable to barley, vast
quantities of which are raised, malted, and in that state sent
out of the county.&nbsp; Both wheat and barley are principally
either drilled, for which several kinds of ingeniously-contrived
<i>barrow-drills</i> are used, or else planted with the hand by
women and children, called <i>dibbling</i>.&nbsp; The latter is
among the agricultural improvements that have originated in this
county: it is very generally practised, and its superiority, in
several respects, or circumstances, over the other methods has
been generally admitted.&nbsp; The quantities produced, according
to the seed sown, are very unequal in different parts of the
county.&nbsp; Lands, in the hundred of Flegg and Marshland,
usually bear six quarters of wheat per acre, and ten of oats; but
in the very light soils, the farmer is glad to obtain two
quarters of oats, and three of barley.&nbsp; The average crops of
the whole county may be stated at three quarters of wheat, and
four of barley, and other articles in proportion, per-acre. <a
name="citation139"></a><a href="#footnote139"
class="citation">[139]</a>&nbsp; Oats are mostly sown only as a
shifting crop, and seldom more is raised than what are consumed
within the county.&nbsp; Other crops are rye, <a
name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 140</span>buck wheat,
peas, beans, vetches or tares, coleseed, clovers, rye and other
artificial grasses; burnet; cocksfoot, chickary, cabbages, mangel
wurzel, luzerne, carrots, and potatoes.&nbsp; The latter, though
so valuable a root, and in other parts used as a preparatory crop
for wheat, has not lately been adopted as a field course in
Norfolk. <a name="citation140a"></a><a href="#footnote140a"
class="citation">[140a]</a>&nbsp; <i>Flax</i> and <i>hemp</i>,
and even <i>mustard</i> and <i>saffron</i> are grown in some
parts about Marshland and the Fens.&mdash;Improved implements and
machines, to facilitate the operations of husbandry, are here in
the greatest variety and perfection.&nbsp; <i>Threshing
machines</i> are become general throughout the county, as are
also <i>drills</i> of all kinds; but a <i>drill-roller</i> has
been supposed to be peculiar to Norfolk.&nbsp; It is a large
cast-iron cylinder, with projecting rings round it, at about ten
inches distance from each other.&nbsp; This being drawn over the
ploughed land makes indentations, and the seed sown
<i>broad-cast</i> chiefly falls into the drills, and is thus
regularly and better deposited than in the common mode of
sowing.&mdash;Among <i>wheel-carriages</i> the non descript one
called a <i>wizzard</i>, or <i>hermaphrodite</i>, is curious and
remarkable; it is the common cart, to which in harvest, or in
pressing circumstances, a couple of temporary forewheels are
placed under the shafts, and two oblique ladders to the frame, by
which it is made to answer the purpose of a waggon: in little
farms, it is an object of no small utility, and in large ones a
great help in a busy season. <a name="citation140b"></a><a

<p><a name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 141</span>The
fat cattle of these parts, except those sold at home to the
butchers, are commonly sent up to London, and sold in Smithfield
Market, by the authorized and sworn salesmen of that place, who
regularly remit the money afterwards to the respective owners, to
their entire satisfaction; for no murmurs against these salesmen,
or reflections unfavourable to their integrity are ever
heard.&nbsp; One man, commonly called <i>a drover</i>, generally
takes charge of the disposable cattle of a whole district, and
among them sometimes very fierce beasts, that would prove
unmanageable to most other people, but which he contrives to
drive along with tolerable ease, assisted only by a trusty and
well-trained <i>dog</i>, his sagacious and constant
companion.</p>
<p>The country eastward of Lynn, towards Westacre and Swaffham,
soon becomes more and more elevated and hilly: the soil also, in
many places, is of a very inferior sort&mdash;and so light,
loose, and sandy, as to be easily, in its ploughed state, drifted
by the wind; for which the <i>marl</i>, that abounds about those
parts, is the very best manure, and almost the only effectual
remedy; and it is generally nigh at hand; often but a few feet
beneath the surface, and under the very soil that wants it.&nbsp;
It is usually laid on very thick, and seldom disappoints the
farmer&rsquo;s wish or expectation, unless the soil be so
incurably sterile as not to admit the marl&rsquo;s incorporating
with it.&nbsp; Wonderful effects have often been produced by this
marling, upon lands that many would have deemed of invincible
sterility.</p>
<p><a name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 142</span>Not
far from the last mentioned town of Swaffham, between Watton and
Merton, is a place called <i>Wayland Wood</i>, which gives name
to the Hundred in which it lies.&nbsp; It is commonly called
<i>Wailing Wood</i>, and tradition has marked it out as the scene
of the pitiable, miserable, and horrid catastrophe recorded and
commemorated in the old and well-known ballad of &ldquo;The
Children in the Wood; or the Norfolk Gentleman&rsquo;s last will
and testament.&rdquo;&nbsp; The origin of the tradition, or the
time when that shocking event happened, cannot now, it seems, be
ascertained.&nbsp; Even Blomefield, with all his antiquarian
sagacity, and extensive means of information, was not able to
find it out.&nbsp; It was probably the occurrence of a very
distant period: but that it really did happen, the ballad and the
tradition may be considered as very sufficient proofs; and the
latter renders it very probable, or rather more than probable,
that Wayland, or Wailing Wood was the very theatre of its
perpetration.&nbsp; Of the untimely and tragical ends of helpless
and friendless orphans, by the procurement of unprincipled,
unfeeling, and cruel relations, who were heirs to their
possessions, the history of rude and barbarous ages furnish but
too many and very shocking examples; and it is devoutly to be
wished that nothing of the kind, or nothing equally inhuman and
shocking, could be said of the history of what are usually called
civilized and enlightened times.</p>
<p>At Saham Tony, not far from Watton and Wayland Wood, lived in
the last century a remarkable person of the name of
<i>Shuckforth</i>.&nbsp; He was a gentleman of good <a
name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 143</span>property,
and resided there on his own estate.&nbsp; On some occasion,
unknown to the present writer, he retired from the world many
years before he died, and gave himself up to reading and
meditation, and to the practice of piety and charity.&nbsp; His
religion appeared to be of that cast that is usually and
assumingly denominated orthodox and evangelical, with no slight
tincture of credulity, superstition, and fanaticism.&nbsp; These,
however, as his life was otherwise so inoffensive and fruitful of
good works, lost in him a great part of their deformity.&nbsp;
His oddities and eccentricities induced many of his neighbours,
of the higher orders, to impute to him a strong twist of
insanity; while a great part of their own conduct would have
gone, perhaps, quite as far in supporting a similar imputation
against themselves.&nbsp; A course of life so singular,
unfashionable, and unadmired, as that which he chose and pursued,
might excite in many no small degree of surprize and disgust, but
it ought not to be taken as a proof of mental derangement.&nbsp;
It was probably the result of the sober exercise of his private
judgement, and of a full conviction that there was no other
course in which he could so well serve God and his fellow
creatures, or promote his own present and future happiness.&nbsp;
He was seldom seen for many of his latter years, except by a few
domestics, one of whom was a constant attendant, and employed to
read to him, after his own eyesight had failed.&nbsp; He is also
supposed to have been the chief agent to distribute his
charities, in the mean time, among the neighbouring poor and
indigent.&nbsp; Close to his house he had a lime-kiln erected,
from an idea <a name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
144</span>that the smell, or effluvia of burning lime conduced to
health and longevity.&nbsp; Thus he passed his time, in innocent
and useful retirement, during a great part of a very long
life.&nbsp; May his opulent survivors imitate his benevolence and
charitable actions, whatever they may think of his
peculiarities.&nbsp; He died in 1781, in his 91st. year, and was
buried in one of his own fields, in a spot which he had fixed
upon, and enclosed for that purpose, near twenty years before;
and where he had erected a tomb, or a kind of mausoleum, with a
long inscription on each of its four sides, or on four different
stones.&nbsp; The inscriptions, as to the style and substance of
them, have no great merit.&nbsp; They possess no elegance; and
may be very truly said to be far more fanciful than
judicious.&nbsp; But of the writer&rsquo;s good intention, no
doubt ought to be entertained.&nbsp; As he had in his lifetime
distinguished himself by numerous acts of benevolence, so at his
death; and by his will, he left divers charitable donations to
the poor of Saham and the neighbouring parishes.&nbsp; Thus did
he, in life and in death, remember the poor, and maintain the
character of the poor man&rsquo;s friend.&nbsp; The blessing of
the poor, and of those who were ready to perish he doubtless
obtained, and even the blessing and approbation of Him who is the
common parent, benefactor, and righteous judge of the rich as
well as the poor, the creator, sustainer, and ruler of the
universe.</p>
<p>The parish churches on this side the Ouse, for the most part,
make but a mean appearance, compared with those of Marshland and
Holland.&nbsp; Here are, however, and always have been other
edifices greatly superior to anything <a name="page145"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 145</span>of the kind found in those
districts: that is, the sumptuous mansions and palaces, for which
this county has been long remarkable, and not inferior, perhaps,
to any part of the kingdom.&nbsp; Of these, the most
distinguished, in former times, were, <i>Rising Castle</i>, once
a royal palace, and the residence, for many years, of queen
<i>Isabel</i>, the relict of Edward II; <i>Gaywode Castle</i>,
the principal mansion, for some ages, of the bishops of Norwich,
and one of the best houses, in the meantime, if not the very
best, in the whole county; <i>Middleton Castle</i>, the seat of
Lord Scales; <i>Wormegay Castle</i>, the seat of lord Bardolf;
<i>Castleacre</i>, the seat of Earl Warren; and <i>Hunstanton
Hall</i>, the seat of the Lestranges.</p>
<p>Among the modern mansions, or palaces, in these parts, the
most distinguished is that of Lord Cholmondeley, at
<i>Houghton</i>, built by the famous Sir Robert Walpole; that of
Thomas William Coke Esq. at <i>Holkham</i>; and that of Lord
Townshend, at <i>Rainham</i>.&nbsp; Besides these, there are many
others worthy of notice; such as that of Mr. Henley, at
<i>Sandringham</i>; that of Mr. Styleman, at <i>Snettisham</i>;
that of Mr. Rolfe, at <i>Hitcham</i>; that of Mr. Coldham, at
<i>Anmer</i>; that of Sir Martin Browne Folkes, at
<i>Hillington</i>; that of Mr. Hamond, at <i>Westacre</i>; that
of Mr. Fountaine, at <i>Narford</i>; that of Mr. Tyssen, at
<i>Narborough</i>; that of Sir Richard Bedingfield, at
<i>Oxborough</i>; that of Mr. Pratt, at <i>Ruston</i>; that of
Mr. Hare, at <i>Stowe</i>; that of Mr. Bell, at
<i>Wallington</i>; and that of Mr. Plestow, at <i>Watlington</i>;
to which several others might be added; but most, if not all of
them, are of inferior consideration.</p>

<p class="gutsumm"><i>A further Account of the Castles</i>,
<i>edifices</i>, <i>and places of ancient note</i>, <i>in these

<i>&amp;c.</i></p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rising</span>, or, as it is commonly
called, <i>Castle-Rising</i>, is generally considered as the most
ancient of all places in this vicinity, except Brancaster, <a
name="citation146"></a><a href="#footnote146"
class="citation">[146]</a> with which it might originally have
some connection.&nbsp; It is supposed to have existed in the time
of the Romans, as one of their military posts, or inferior
stations, which Spelman thought not improbable, from its
situation, and the coins there discovered.&nbsp; But it seems by
no means clear, or certain, that it is a place of so much greater
antiquity than Lynn, as is generally supposed.&nbsp; As a
borough, it may, and seems to be the most ancient of the two; but
that its origin, as a town, was much, if at all, anterior to that
of Lynn, is not so very probable or indubitable as most people
have imagined.&nbsp; That it is a place of great antiquity, must
however be allowed, <a name="page147"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 147</span>as well as that it was formerly of
far greater extent, population, and consequence, than it is at
present, and than it has been for several ages; otherwise it
could, surely, never have acquired the rank of a corporate town,
with distinct municipal laws, chartered rights, and the privilege
of sending members to parliament&mdash;even as many as the county
itself: which must always have been absurd enough, but especially
at this time, when it is actually one of the most inconsiderable
villages within the whole county.&nbsp; It is said to have been
formerly a noted sea-port; but the silt and sand, choking up its
harbour, have long deprived it of that advantage.&nbsp; To that
cause the decay of the town is, probably, to be ascribed.&nbsp;
Spelman says, that Rising is a burgh of such high antiquity, that
the royal archives and records give no account of it.&nbsp; But
may it not be questioned, if his premises will really warrant his
conclusion? or, if the silence of the archives and records
amounts to a proof of its high antiquity, as a burgh?&nbsp; Might
not that silence be owing to some other cause? and may it not be
concluded, that the origin of some burghs, of which those
archives and records give an account, is yet more ancient than
that of Rising?</p>
<p>In its better times, Rising had two weekly markets, Mondays
and Thursdays; and also a fair, or free mart, for fifteen days,
from the feast of St. Matthew.&nbsp; But they have been long
discontinued, and it is doubtful, if any one now can tell when
that happened.&nbsp; Rising has now neither market nor fair,
except a paltry, peddling merrimake, on or about Mayday; the
miserable <a name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
148</span>remnant, probably, of the fifteen days mart.&nbsp;
Formerly the town was governed by a mayor, recorder, twelve
aldermen, a speaker of the commons, and fifty (some say seventy)
burgesses.&nbsp; At present the Corporation consists of two
aldermen, who alternately serve the office of mayor, and return
two members to parliament, the mayor being the returning
officer.&nbsp; The burgage tenures are the property of Mr Howard,
and Lord Cholmondeley; and though five or six names generally
appear upon the poll, at an election for members of parliament,
it is said to be very doubtful, whether there is a single
<i>legal voter</i> belonging to the burgh, except the rector. <a
name="citation148"></a><a href="#footnote148"
class="citation">[148]</a>&nbsp; The arms are a <i>Castle triple
towered</i>.&nbsp; We are told that this burgh first sent members
to parliament in 1558.</p>
<p>The Church of Rising is an ancient pile, dedicated to St
Lawrence, and built in the conventual form, with a tower between
the body of it and the chancel, which last is now in ruins; the
walls only of part of it being standing; also a south cross
aisle, joining to the tower, which is entirely in ruins.&nbsp;
The west end is adorned with antique carving, and small arches;
the roof of the church is flat, covered with lead.&mdash;Near the
east-end of the churchyard stands an hospital, built by Henry
Howard, earl of Northampton, in the reign of James I.&nbsp; It is
a square building, containing twelve apartments for twelve poor
women, and one good room for the governess, with a spacious hall
and kitchen, and a decent chapel.&nbsp; It is endowed with
100<i>l.</i> a year, out of lands in Rising, Roydon, S. and N.
Wootton, and Gaywood; <a name="page149"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 149</span>also with 5<i>l.</i> every fifth
year, toward keeping it in repair, from an hospital in Greenwich,
founded also by the said earl of Northampton, and commonly called
<i>Norfolk College</i>, for a Warden and twenty pensioners, of
whom twelve must be parishioners of Greenwich, and eight of
Rising and Shotisham in Norfolk, whose allowance is eight
shillings a week for commons, besides clothes, lodging, and
salaries, which are varied at the discretion of the
managers.&nbsp; The whole income of the said college, or
hospital, amounts to about 1100<i>l</i> yearly. <a
name="citation149"></a><a href="#footnote149"
class="citation">[149]</a>&mdash;The allowance at Rising hospital
is eight shillings a month for each pensioner, and twelve
shillings for the Governess, with some addition on certain saints
days, or festivals; also one chaldron of coals yearly for each,
and two for the governess.&nbsp; Each has also a new gown every
year, with a livery-gown, and hat, every seventh year.&mdash;The
pensioners must be all single women, of an unblemished character,
and free from all suspicion of heresy, blasphemy, and
atheism.&nbsp; A further account of this institution may be seen
in the different histories of the county.</p>
<p>The <i>Castle</i> of Rising is of much more modern origin than
the town itself.&nbsp; It is supposed to have been built about
the middle of the 12th century, by William de Albini, first Earl
of Sussex, and son of another William de Albini, who was butler
to William Rufus, and to whom that king had made a grant of
Rising, upon the defection or rebellion of his uncle Odo, bishop
of <a name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
150</span>Bayeux and Earl of Kent, to whom his brother, the
conqueror, had granted it, upon the forfeiture and seizure of the
vast temporalities of Stigand archbishop of Canterbury, in whose
possession it was before the conquest.&nbsp; The Earl of Sussex
is said to have been one of the most celebrated warriors of the
age in which he lived, and to have married <i>Adeliza</i> the
dowager queen of Henry I. from which last circumstance the Castle
of Rising appears to have been from the very first a royal
palace.&nbsp; This Castle and lordship continued in the Albini
family till the death of Earl <i>Hugh</i>, in 1243, when they
went, together with the fourth part of the Tollbooth of Lynn, to
Roger de Montalto, lord of Montalt, (in Flintshire) by his
marriage to Cecily, fourth daughter and coheiress of William Earl
of Sussex, and one of the Sisters of Earl Hugh, who made it his
chief seat, and place of residence.&nbsp; It continued afterward,
with all its appurtenances, in the Montalto family, till the
death of Robert Lord Montalt, in 1329, when Emma his widow
surrendered and conveyed them, with all her other possessions and
castles, agreeable to a former deed, executed in the life time of
her husband, to the dowager queen <i>Isabel</i>, the mother of
Edward III.&nbsp; In 1330, soon after the trial and execution of
her great favourite Mortimer, the Castle of Rising became the
chief place of that queen&rsquo;s residence, and continued to be
so ever after to the time of her death, in 1358, when it
descended to her grandson, Edward the black prince; but it does
not appear that he ever resided there, though it seems very
probable that he had been there often in the time of his
grandmother.&nbsp; In the second year of the <a
name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 151</span>reign of
his son, Richard II. it was granted by that king to John
Montfort, surnamed the valiant, Earl of Richmond, and Duke of
Britany (the husband of his half sister <i>Joan</i>) in exchange
for the town and castle of Brest.&nbsp; On the defection of
Montfort, about twelve years after, the king gave it to his uncle
Thomas of Woodstock, Duke of Gloucester; who being murdered at
Calais, in 1398, Edmund of Langley, Duke of York, another of the
king&rsquo;s uncles, obtained a grant of it, with the manors of
Beeston, Mileham, &amp;c. in Norfolk; and at his death, in 1403,
it came to his eldest son Edward, Duke of York; who being slain
in the memorable battle of Agincourt, it came to his brother
Richard Earl of Cambridge; and he being beheaded the same year,
it fell to the Crown, where it remained till the 36th of Hen.
VIII. when it was granted, with its manor and appurtenances,
together with the manors of Thorpe, Gaywood, South Walsham,
&amp;c. &amp;c. to Thomas Howard Duke of Norfolk, and Henry his
Son, Earl of Arundel and Surry, in exchange for the manors of
Walton, Trimley, Falkenham, &amp;c. &amp;c.&nbsp; On the
attainder of the Duke of Norfolk, in 15th Elizabeth, it came
again to the crown, and was granted to Edward, Earl of Oxford;
but this grant being soon revoked, it was then granted to Henry
Howard, Earl of Northampton, brother to the said Duke; and it
seems to have continued in the Howard family ever since, together
with its appurtenances, with the exception of a small farm, which
was purchased by Sir Robert Walpole, and is now in the possession
of his descendant, the present Lord <a name="page152"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 152</span>Cholmondeley, which secures him a
moiety of the influence, or command of the borough, in the
election of members of Parliament.&nbsp; Among the titles of the
Duke of Norfolk is that of <i>baron</i>, or <i>lord Howard</i>,
<i>of Castle Rising</i>.</p>
<p>The Castle, as Parkin observes,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;stands upon a hill, on the south side of
the town, from whence is a fine prospect over land and an arm of
the sea.&nbsp; Great part of the walls of the keep, or inward
tower, are still standing, being a gothic pile, much resembling
that of Norwich, and little inferior; the walls are about three
yards thick, consisting chiefly of freestone, with [some] iron,
or car stone; encompassed with a great circular ditch, and bank
of earth, on which stood also a strong stone wall, as appears by
a presentment, in 31st Elizabeth, when the wall on the said bank
was said to be in part, and the rest in danger of being
overthrown, by the warrener&rsquo;s conies.&nbsp; This ditch, now
dry, was formerly, probably, filled with water.&nbsp; There is
but one entrance to it, [which is] on the eastside, over a strong
stone bridge, about thirty paces long, and eight or nine broad,
supported by a single arch, over which stood a gate-house.&nbsp;
The inward part of the castle, or keep, is all in ruins, except
the room, where the court leet of that lordship is
held.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The apartments were doubtless grand and sumptuous when queen
Isabel resided here, and when her son the great king Edward III.
and his queen and court were among her guests.&nbsp; A house
resorted to by the very first personages in the kingdom, or in
Europe, and which could furnish suitable accommodation and <a
name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
153</span>entertainment for them, may well be supposed to have
been both capacious and commodious, as well fitted up in a style
of superior elegance and magnificence.&nbsp; Some of our
historians say, that the king used to visit his mother here, once
or twice annually, for many years.</p>
<p>In 1340, the king and queen were here for some time, as
appears from the account rolls of Adam de Reffham, and John de
Newland, of Lynn, who sent his majesty, in the mean while, a
present of wine.&nbsp; In the summer of that year workmen were
employed at the Castle in making preparations, and the queen sent
her precept to the Mayor of Lynn, for eight carpenters to assist
on the occasion.&nbsp; Afterward, in 1344, the King and his court
were here for some time, as appears from certain Letters which he
sent from hence to the bishop of Norwich, then at Avignon, to be
there delivered by him to the Pope.&nbsp; On the 22nd August,
1358, queen Isabel died at this Castle; and in November following
her remains were taken to London, and buried there in the Church
of the Grey Friars, now called Christ Church, where also (it
seems) her favourite Mortimer had been buried.</p>
<p>It is somewhat remarkable, that few of our historians seem to
know where this queen resided during the last 28 years of her
life, or to have the least idea of this Castle being ever the
place of her residence.&nbsp; Rapin, and Hume, and also the
author, or authors of the Parliamentary history, call the place
of her habitation or <a name="page154"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 154</span>confinement, &ldquo;Rising Castle,
<i>near London</i>,&rdquo; (they should have said, <i>near
Lynn</i>,) and Petit Andrews calls it &ldquo;the castle of
<i>Risings</i>, <i>in Surry</i>;&rdquo; whereas it is a most
unquestionable fact, that it was no other than this very castle
of Rising tie <i>Norfolk</i>, which was formerly, as we have
seen, a place of no small note and consequence.&nbsp; But its
best days are past, and its glory is departed.</p>
<p>Of <span class="smcap">Hunston</span>, or <i>Hunstanton
Hall</i>, not much is known that is worth recording.&nbsp; It was
long the chief seat and residence of the ancient family of the
Lestranges; of which the most notable person, perhaps, was the
famous <i>Sir Roger Lestrange</i>, who wrote and published more
books than most of his contemporaries; of some of which he was
himself the author, of others the translator only.&nbsp; He was
also among our earliest editors of Newspapers, and always a
flaming church-and-king-man.&nbsp; Queen Mary the second is said
to have anagrammed his name into <i>Strange lying
Roger</i>.&nbsp; Hunston House, or Hall, is now uninhabited, and
in ruins; and is the property of Mr Styleman of Snettisham, a
descendant of the Lestranges by the female line.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Castleacre</span> was formerly the
principal seat and residence of the great <i>Earls Warren</i>,
who lived here in all the rude pomp and feudal splendor which
distinguished the great Norman barons, whom the conqueror
introduced into this country, and who largely shared in the
fortunes of their successful leader.&nbsp; The 11th 12th and 13th
centuries were the times when the Earls Warren flourished
most.&nbsp; King Edward I. was entertained at this Castle in
1297, by the then Earl Warren, <a name="page155"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 155</span>who was one of the most powerful
among the English nobility of that time.&nbsp; The first English
peer of that name was nearly allied to the conqueror, and
accompanied him hither.&nbsp; He died in 1089.&nbsp; He that was
the founder of Castleacre is said to have owned no less than one
hundred and forty lordships, or manors, in Norfolk alone; and
yet, among them all, no spot pleased him so well as Castleacre;
and therefore he determined to fix there his chief residence, and
to erect an edifice suitable to his high rank and vast
possessions.&nbsp; This Castle, or Palace, stood on a rising
ground, including, with all its outworks and fortifications,
about eighteen acres of ground, in a circular form.&nbsp; Through
this there is now a way, or street, called Baily Street, running
directly north and south.&nbsp; At the entrance of this street,
on the north, stands a stone gate-house, with two round
bastions.&nbsp; The gate-house had an inward and outward door,
with a portcullis in the middle.&nbsp; A similar gate-house is
supposed to have stood at the opposite, or south entrance.&nbsp;
On the east side of the north gate was a chapel for the Castle,
the walls of which are still standing; and on the east side of
the said street, near the middle, was another stone gate-house,
leading into the outward court of the great Castle, which was
circular, enclosed with a strong and lofty wall, of freestone and
flint, &amp;c. embattled, seven feet thick.&nbsp; Further in is a
deep ditch, and a lofty embattled wall round it.&nbsp; Within
this is the keep; and across the ditch are three lofty walls at
proper distances, which join the Castle wall, as buttresses
&amp;c.&nbsp; The other part of the fortifications, on the west
side of Baily Street, is called the Barbican, <a
name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 156</span>and
contains above ten acres of land, and was enclosed with deep
ditches, entrenchments, and high ramparts.&mdash;Several coins of
Vespasian, Constantine &amp;c. have been found here, and the spot
is supposed to have been originally a Roman station.&nbsp; From
the North part of it there is said to run a way, by Castleacre
Wicken, and from thence across the country, leaving Massingham
and Houghton on the right, and Anmer on the left; then tending in
a direct course, leaving Fring a little on the right, for
Ringstead and Brancaster, which latter is known to have been a
considerable Roman station.&nbsp; This way is said to be commonly
called the Pedder&rsquo;s Way, and probably went much further
than Castleacre, even as far, at least, as Castor by Norwich, the
Venta Icenorum of antiquity.&mdash;From the beauty of the
situation of Castleacre, and the noble ruins at present
remaining, of which the semicircular wall of the Castle is a very
grand and striking part, the late Earl of Leicester, at one time,
as it is said, entertained an idea of building there: a situation
which has been judged every way superior to that of Holkham,
which he afterward fixed upon.&nbsp; His Lordship has been by
some much blamed on this occasion; justly or not, cannot be made
here a subject of inquiry.&mdash;A little to the west of the
Castle stood the ancient <i>Priory</i> of Castleacre; which was a
building of great note for many ages.&nbsp; The priory church was
a large venerable gothic pile, built in a cathedral or conventual
form: the principal entrance was through a great arch, over which
was a stately window; on each side of the great door were other
doors to enter into the north and south aisles <a
name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 157</span>under the
tower, as the grand door served as an entrance into the nave or
body; at the north and south end of this front or west end, stood
two towers, supported by strong arches, or pillars; the nave, or
body, had twelve great pillars, making seven arches on each side,
the lowest joining to the towers; on the east end of the nave
stood the grand tower supported by four great pillars, through
which was the entrance into the choir: on the south and north
side of this tower were two cross aisles or transepts, and at the
end of the north transept there seems to have been a chapel, or
vestiary.&nbsp; The choir was of an equal breadth with the nave
and aisles, but much shorter, and at the east end of it was in
form of a chapel, and here stood the high altar.&mdash;The
cloister was on the south side, and had an entrance at the west
end, and another at the east end of the south aisle, The chapter
house joined to the east side, and the dormitory was over the
west part of the cloister, and adjoining was the prior&rsquo;s
apartment.</p>
<p>Castleacre was purchased, of his relations the Cecils, by lord
chief justice Coke, and is now the property of his descendant,
Thomas Wm. Coke Esq. of Holkham.</p>
<p>Of <span class="smcap">Wirmegay</span>, or <span
class="smcap">Wormegay Castle</span> but little seems to be known
at present, save that it was long the seat or residence of the
Lords <i>Bardolf</i>, who had great possessions, and bore no
small sway for a long time in these parts.&nbsp; This Castle of
theirs appears to have been a place of considerable strength and
consequence.&nbsp; King Edward II. in his 18th year, is said to
have sent his precept to Lord Bardolf, to have great care and
guard <a name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 158</span>of
it, on account of the supposed approach of his queen and his
enemy Mortimer; as he also did to Lord Montalt in regard to his
Castle of Rising: which seems to imply, that they were two of the
most important places then in these parts.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Middleton Castle</span> <a
name="citation158"></a><a href="#footnote158"
class="citation">[158]</a> was long the chief seat of the Lords
<i>Scales</i>, descended from Hardewin, or Harlewin de Scalariis,
lord of Waddon in Cambridgeshire, probably one of the
conqueror&rsquo;s favourite captains.&nbsp; The first footing
which that family had at Middleton is supposed to have been in
the reign of Henry II. by the marriage of Roger de Scales, with
Muriel, daughter and coheiress of Jeffrey de Lisewis.&nbsp; The
family afterward resided here, and had great possessions and
power in these parts, for many generations.&nbsp; At what time
the Castle was built is not known; but it was, probably, in the
time of the said Roger, or at an early part of the residence of
that family in this neighbourhood.&nbsp; It continued in the
Scales family till the reign of Edward IV. when it passed into
that of the Wodeviles, by the marriage of the memorable Anthony
Wodevile Earl Rivers, and Elizabeth the heiress of Thomas the
last Lord Scales.&nbsp; After the fall of the Wodeviles, it is
said to have been granted, by Richard III. to the Duke of
Norfolk.&nbsp; At the accession of Henry VII. being forfeited
with the Duke&rsquo;s other possessions, it went to the heiress
of the Scales, in the person of the countess of Oxford.&nbsp;
Afterward it passed by marriage to the Lord Latimer, and thence,
from time to time, into <a name="page159"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 159</span>other hands; such as Sir Edward
Williams, Sir Roger Mostyn, &amp;c.&nbsp; Of this ancient Castle
nothing now remains but the gate-house, or tower, which is still
pretty entire, and seems to have been the entrance into a court,
or quadrangle, which was moated in.&nbsp; This tower is built of
brick, about seventeen yards long, nine broad, and eighteen high,
with turrets, &amp;c.&nbsp; Over the arch is the shield of
Scales; the inside of it is much decayed; the area, or court
within is about eighty four paces long, and forty six
broad.&nbsp; The situation is low and swampy, and what would not
now be deemed very eligible for the habitation or residence of a
noble or genteel family.&nbsp; The power and possessions the
Scales were formerly very great in these parts.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gaywood Castle</span> stood where the farm
house, called Gaywood Hall, now stands, as appears from the
<i>moat</i> which surrounds it, and which must once have
encircled a fortified edifice.&nbsp; That edifice could be no
other than the castle or palace of Gaywood, which was long the
favourite, or principal mansion and residence of the bishops of
Norwich, who were from an early period the temporal as well as
spiritual lords of Lynn; on which account the town was then
called Bishop&rsquo;s Lynn, or Lynn Bishop.&nbsp; So high and
mighty was the bishop&rsquo;s lordly sway then at Lynn, that the
very Mayor was nominated and appointed by him, and was called
<i>the bishop&rsquo;s man</i>, being in fact only his bailiff, or
deputy.&nbsp; Afterward, the Mayor&rsquo;s power becoming more
extensive and independent, would sometimes occasion no <a
name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 160</span>small
disagreement and strife between him and his prelatical master: a
very notable instance of which occurred in the reign of Richard
II. and the time of the famous bishop <i>Spencer</i>, of
persecuting, fighting, and crusading memory.&nbsp; This prelate,
being one day in the town with his retinue, quarrelled with the
Mayor (who was supported by the townsmen) on a point of frivolous
etiquette.&nbsp; From words, the parties came to blows; and a
very serious battle ensued, which terminated in the total defeat
of the haughty prelate and his company, who were all driven out
of town, many of them much bruised and wounded.&nbsp; This bishop
Spencer was sometime after appointed generalissimo of Pope
<i>Urban&rsquo;s</i> forces, in the war he then waged against the
antipope <i>Clement</i> of Avignon; as is related by Fox.&nbsp;
It was he also who afterward prosecuted for heresy William
Sawtre, then minister of St. Margaret&rsquo;s, and the first who
suffered under the Act <i>De h&aelig;retico comburendo</i>.&nbsp;
Of these matters a more particular account shall be given in
relating the history of the town, at that period.</p>
<p>The bishops having so much to do at Lynn, and deriving from it
so much of their consequence, it was natural for them to choose
to reside in its vicinity: hence the origin of the castle, or
palace of Gaywood.&nbsp; At what time it was first built cannot
now perhaps be ascertained.&nbsp; We are told that bishop John de
Grey (about 1200, or soon after) erected, or rebuilt, a sumptuous
palace here, for himself and successors, where he much
resided.&nbsp; Succeeding bishops continued to reside here, and
to pay attention to the improvement of the grounds, <a
name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 161</span>as well as
of the palace.&nbsp; A deer park, and a warren, appear to have
been made here by bishop William de Raleigh, about 1240; who also
granted liberty of common pasture to the Earl of Arundel and
Sussex, and his men, from the park of Bawsey to the bridge of
Gaywood, and the cawsey between the river of Bawsey and the wood
of the said Earl.&nbsp; In 1388, bishop Spencer, abovementioned,
had licence to embattle his palace of Gaywood.&nbsp; This seems
to have been after his return from the crusade, or war, in which
he had been engaged for Pope Urban, against his competitor Pope
Clement, as he had been appointed commander in chief five years
before.&nbsp; From the high spirit and wealth of this proud
prelate, it may be presumed that Gaywood Castle made a very
splendid and princely appearance in his time; and it is likely
that the same might be the case long after, even till the reign
of Henry VIII. when it was surrendered, together with the
bishop&rsquo;s rights and immunities at Lynn, into the
King&rsquo;s hands.&nbsp; It was soon after, with its
appurtenances, granted to the Duke of Norfolk, and then probably
pulled down.&nbsp; Its site, and the adjoining estate passed
afterward to the Thoresbys of Haveless hall, in Mintling; and
from them to the Wyches, of Hockwold; and latterly to Philip Case
Esq.&mdash;and now are the property of William Bagge Esq. of
Lynn.&nbsp; Of the castle, or palace of Gaywood, no more needs
now be said, but that it is fallen, never more, in all
probability, to rise, or recover the least portion of its ancient
splendor and consequence.</p>
<p><a name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
162</span>Besides the castles, or palaces above mentioned, there
were formerly in this country many religious houses, of different
orders, and some of them of considerable note: among which were
Blackburgh priory, in Middleton; Castleacre priory; Westacre
priory; Crab-house nunnery, by Maudlin; West Dereham Abbey;
Flitcham priory; Massingham priory, and Pentney priory.&nbsp; Of
these some were extensive and noble edifices, and had large
possessions attached to them; but scarce any remains of most of
them are now to be seen, and their very memory seems to be
approaching fast towards oblivion.&nbsp; Such is the fate of the
firmest fabrics: like those who constructed them, they were
composed of perishing materials.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Section</span> III.</h4>
<p class="gutsumm"><i>Further Account of the modern palaces</i>,
<i>and other notable mansions in this
country</i>.&mdash;<i>Houghton&mdash;Holkham&mdash;Rainham&mdash;Narford&mdash;Narborough&mdash;Oxborough</i>.</p>
<p>Of all the fine houses that now exist in this vicinity, and
even throughout all the eastern parts of England, the precedence,
in point of size and magnificence at least, is allowed to be due
to</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Houghton Hall</span>, now the princely
seat of the Earl of Cholmondeley, but formerly of the Earls of
Orford, of the Walpole family, from which the present possessor
is maternally descended.&nbsp; This Splendid <a
name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 163</span>Mansion was
built by the memorable Sir Robert Walpole, while he was prime
minister, and between the years 1722 and 1735.&nbsp; The whole
extent of the building, including the Colonade and wings, which
contain the offices, is four hundred and fifty feet: the main
body of the house extends one hundred and sixty six feet.&nbsp;
The whole building is of stone, and crowned with an entablature
of the Ionic order, on which is a balustrade.&nbsp; At each
corner is a Cupola, surmounted with a lanthorn.&nbsp; For a
description of the inside of the house, the reader is referred to
the Norfolk Tour and other printed accounts.&nbsp; It has been
long distinguished for its noble <i>Collection of pictures</i>,
by the best masters; but it is no longer there; it was sold in
1779 to the late Empress of Russia, for 45,500<i>l.</i>&nbsp; Its
removal out of the kingdom has been, much regretted, as a very
humiliating circumstance, and a national disgrace; and it has
been thought that the legislature ought to have purchased it,
rather than suffer it to be taken out of the kingdom.&nbsp; But
it is unavailing now to lament: that celebrated collection is
irrecoverably lost to Britain.&nbsp; Sometime before the removal
of those pictures Lord Orford gave Mr Boydell permission to take
drawings of them, which he proposed having engraved by the first
artists, and published in fourteen numbers, at two guineas each,
which has been since done.</p>
<p>The duke of Lorrain, afterward Emperor of Germany, and husband
to Maria Theresa, was once entertained by Sir Robert Walpole, at
Houghton, with more than British magnificence.&mdash;Relays of
horses were, in the <a name="page164"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 164</span>meantime, provided on the roads, to
bring rarities thither from the remotest parts of the kingdom,
with all possible speed: and this extraordinary expedient, it
seems, was continued all the while that august guest staid at
Houghton.&nbsp; Sir Robert&rsquo;s expenses, in buildings and
entertainments, must have been so very great, that one is apt to
wonder how he could manage to bear them, but he was a prime
minister, and prime ministers are supposed capable of doing great
things in the pecuniary way, without embarrassing
themselves.&nbsp; One of Sir Robert&rsquo;s successors, however,
a late prime minister, seems to have been an exception to that
idea: with ample means, and without any great apparent outgoings,
(except what his private revels, or midnight orgies, might cost
him) he could by no means manage to live, or keep out of debt,
and actually died insolvent!&mdash;Circumstances so dissimilar in
the history of two men who stood in the same situation, must
needs be deemed somewhat odd and remarkable.</p>
<p>The woods, or plantations, about Houghton are extensive, and
thought very fine.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In the road from Syderstone (says the
Author of the <i>Norfolk Tour</i>) they appear we think to the
greatest advantage; they are seen to a great extent, with
openings left judiciously in many places, to let in the view of
more distant woods; which changes the shade, and gives them that
solemn brownness which has always a great effect.&nbsp; The
flatness of the country, however, is a circumstance which,
instead of setting them off, and making them appear larger than
they really are, gives them a diminutive air, <a
name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 165</span>in
comparison to the number of acres really planted.&nbsp; For were
these vast plantations disposed upon ground with great
inequalities of surface, such as hills rising one above another,
or vast slopes stretching away to the right and left, they would
appear to be almost boundless, and shew twenty times the extent
they do at present.&nbsp; The woods which are seen from the south
front of the house, are planted with great judgment, to remedy
the effect of the country&rsquo;s flatness; for they are so
disposed as to appear one beyond another, in different shades,
and to a great extent.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Next to Houghton (if that expression may be allowed) the very
best house in all this part of the kingdom is</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Holkham House</span>, the splendid Seat
and residence of Thomas William Coke, Esq. the far-famed patron
of the Norfolk agriculturists, and one of the representatives of
the county in this and several of the preceding
parliaments.&nbsp; Mr Coke is also a descendant of the famous
Lord chief justice of that name, who was himself a Norfolk
man.&nbsp; Holkham is not of so long standing as Houghton: it was
begun in 1734 by the Earl of Leicester and completed by his
dowager countess, in 1760.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The central part of this spacious mansion,
built of white brick, is accompanied by four wings, or pavilions,
which are connected with it by rectilinear corridors, or
galleries: each of the two fronts therefore display a centre and
two wings.&nbsp; The south front presents an air of lightness and
elegance, arising from the justness of its proportions.&nbsp; In
the centre is a bold portico, with its entablature supported by
six corinthian <a name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
166</span>columns.&nbsp; The north front is the grand or
principal entrance, and exhibits different, though handsome
features.&nbsp; The wings which partake of similar
characteristics, have been thought to diminish from the general
magnificence of the building, by the want of uniformity of style
with the south front, and being too much detached to be
consistent with unity.&nbsp; The centre, which extends 345 feet
in length, by 180 in depth, comprises the principal apartments:
each wing has its respective destination.&nbsp; One contains the
kitchens, servants&rsquo;-hall, and some sleeping rooms.&nbsp; In
the chapel wing is the dairy, laundry, with more sleeping
rooms.&nbsp; Another contains the suit of family apartments; and
the fourth, called the strangers&rsquo; wing, is appropriated to
visitors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This grand residence is rendered superior to most other
great houses in the kingdom, by its <i>convenience</i> and
appropriate arrangement.&nbsp; The entrance <i>hall</i>, which
forms a cube, has a gallery round it, supported by twenty four
Ionic columns.&nbsp; Next is the <i>saloon</i>, on each side of
which is a drawing room; and connected to this is the <i>state
dressing-room</i> and <i>bed chamber</i>.&nbsp; Another
<i>drawing room</i> communicates with the <i>statue gallery</i>,
which connects a number of apartments in a most admirable manner;
for one octagon opens into the private wing, and the other into
the strangers&rsquo;, on one side, and into the dining-room on
the other.&nbsp; This dining-room is on one side of the hall; and
on the other is Mrs. Coke&rsquo;s bed-room, dressing-room, and
closets.&nbsp; From the recess, in the dining-room, opens a <a
name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 167</span>door on the
stair case, which immediately leads to the offices; and in the
centre of the wings, by the saloon door, are invisible
stair-cases, which lead to all the rooms and respective
offices.&nbsp; Thus here are four general suits of apartments,
all perfectly distinct from each other, with no reciprocal
thoroughfares; the state, Mrs Coke&rsquo;s, the late
earl&rsquo;s, and the strangers&rsquo;.&nbsp; These severally
open into what may be called common rooms, the statue gallery,
and saloon, all which communicate with the dining room.&nbsp;
There may be houses larger and more magnificent, and in some more
uniformity and justness of proportion may be visible; but human
genius could not contrive any thing in which convenience could be
more apparent than in this.&nbsp; The fitting up of the interior
is in the most splendid style, and, in numerous instances with
the most elegant taste.&nbsp; The ceilings of many of the rooms
are of curious gilt, fret, and mosaic work; the Venetian windows
are ornamented with handsome pillars, and also profusely
gilded.&nbsp; The marble chimney pieces are all handsome; but
three are peculiarly deserving attention, for their exquisite
sculpture.&nbsp; Two are in the dining-room, one ornamented with
a sow and pigs, and a wolf; the other has a bear and bee hives,
finely sculptured in white marble.&nbsp; A third, representing
two pelicans, is exceedingly chaste and beautiful.&nbsp; The
marble side-boards, agate-tables, rich tapestry, silk furniture,
beds &amp;c. are all in the same sumptuous style of elegance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <i>Statue Gallery</i> consists of a central part
and two octagonal ends.&nbsp; The first is seventy feet long, by
<a name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 168</span>twenty
two feet wide, and each octagon, of twenty two feet in diameter,
opens to the centre, by an handsome arch.&nbsp; One end is
furnished with books, and the other with statues, &amp;c.&nbsp;
Among the latter, the figure of <i>Diana</i> is extremely
fine.&nbsp; A <i>Venus</i>, clothed with wet drapery, is
considered exquisite.&nbsp; The Saloon is forty feet long, twenty
eight wide, and thirty two in height.&nbsp; This room,
appropriated for paintings, contains many by the most eminent
masters; but they are not exclusively preserved in this; a vast
collection being distributed over most of the apartments
throughout the house.&mdash;In a brief statement it will be
impossible to give a just and adequate delineation of the
pleasure grounds and park, with the various objects which environ
and decorate this museum of taste and seat of hospitality.&rdquo;
<a name="citation168"></a><a href="#footnote168"
class="citation">[168]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nor would such a delineation be very necessary for this work,
as but few of its readers can be supposed altogether unacquainted
with the premises.&mdash;After Holkham, the next place is due
to</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Rainham Hall</span>, the venerable seat
and residence of the late <i>marquis Townshend</i>.&nbsp; This
house is of a much longer standing than either of the former;
being built, as we are told, about 1630, by Sir Roger Townshend,
bart. under the direction of that excellent and celebrated
architect Inigo Jones.&nbsp; Its situation has been supposed the
most delightful in the county.&nbsp; The house itself, though it
has been greatly improved by the late marquis, is said to be in
the style of an exceeding good habitable mansion rather than a
magnificent one.&nbsp; The <a name="page169"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 169</span>country around is rich, and
charmingly cultivated.&nbsp; The park and woods are beautiful,
and the lake below peculiarly striking.&nbsp; Extensive lawns,
and opening views into the country, enrich the enlivening scene,
and display the beauties and bounties of nature in their most
enchanting and luxuriant pride. <a name="citation169"></a><a
href="#footnote169" class="citation">[169]</a>&nbsp; Since the
death of the late marquis this house has ceased to be the
residence of the family.&mdash;To the preceding Mansions may be
added</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Oxborough</span>, or <span
class="smcap">Oxburgh-Hall</span>, the seat of the
<i>Bedingfields</i>, which is said to present features of a
striking kind, and to be a peculiar and interesting remnant of
ancient domestic architecture.&nbsp; It was erected as long ago
as the latter end of the fifteenth century, by Sir <i>Edmund
Bedingfield</i>, who obtained a grant, or patent of Edward IV. in
1482, to build the manor house with towers, battlements,
&amp;c.&nbsp; It is built of brick, and was originally of a
square form, environing a court, or quadrangle, one hundred and
eighteen feet long, and ninety two broad; round which the
apartments were ranged.&nbsp; The whole building resembles
Queen&rsquo;s College, in Cambridge; a structure of about the
same period.&nbsp; The entrance is over a bridge, formerly a
drawbridge, through an arched gate way, between two majestic
towers, which are eighty feet high.&nbsp; In the western tower is
a winding brick staircase beautifully turned, and lighted by
quatrefoil ilet-holes.&nbsp; The other tower is divided into four
stories; each consisting of an octagonal room, with arched
ceilings, stone window <a name="page170"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 170</span>frames, and stone fire places.&nbsp;
Between the turrets is an arched entrance gateway, the roof of
which is supported by numerous groins; and over this is a large
handsome room, having one window to the north and two bow windows
to the south.&nbsp; These windows, and the whole exterior of this
part of the building appear to be in their original state.&nbsp;
The floor of the great room is paved with small fine bricks, and
the walls covered with very curious tapestry.&nbsp; This appears
to be of the age of Henry VII. and is mentioned in several wills
of the family.&nbsp; The apartment is called &ldquo;the
King&rsquo;s room,&rdquo; and is supposed to have been
appropriated to the monarch just mentioned, when he visited
Oxburgh.&nbsp; In the eastern turret is a curious small closet,
called a <i>hiding place</i>, which appears to have been an
original part of the structure: it is a cavity, or hollow in the
solid wall, measuring six feet by five feet, and seven feet high,
and is approached by a secret passage through the floor.&nbsp; A
similar hiding place is said to have been destroyed in that part
of the building which has been taken down.&nbsp; The great hall,
which had an oaken roof, in the style of the justly admired one
at Westminster Hall; and other rooms, which formed the south side
of the court, were taken down in 1778, and the distribution of
almost every apartment has been successively changed.&nbsp; The
offices are now on the east side, and the dining parlour, drawing
room, and library, on the west.&nbsp; The whole is surrounded by
a moat, about fifty two feet broad, and ten feet deep, which is
supplied with water from an adjacent rivulet.&nbsp; In the
different apartments, which are both spacious and elegant, <a
name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 171</span>are
preserved a few good pictures, by eminent painters, and a
collection of ancient armoury. <a name="citation171"></a><a
href="#footnote171" class="citation">[171]</a>&nbsp; This
venerable seat is the property of Sir Richard Bedingfield, but at
present the residence of Lord Mountjoy.</p>
<p>Of the other modern mansions in these parts, mentioned at the
close of the first section of this chapter, it seems needless
here to give any further account, except those of <i>Narford</i>
and <i>Narborough</i>.&nbsp; These, it must be allowed, deserve a
more particular attention; not on account of the structures
themselves, but of the curious and valuable articles they
contain&mdash;or lately did contain; for what did once so much
distinguish <span class="smcap">Narborough Hall</span>, is no
longer there.&mdash;It was a <i>noble collection</i> of
<i>coins</i> and <i>medals</i>, ancient and modern; and the most
valuable private collection, perhaps, in Britain, if not in
Europe.&nbsp; Its possessor, the late Mr. Tyssen, assured this
writer, that it had cost him, from first to last, above
20,000<i>l.</i> though he had been fortunate enough to purchase
many of the most valuable articles much under the prices they
usually fetch.&nbsp; In this collection were coins of the Grecian
states and cities; a regular series of those of Philip and
Alexander, of Alexander&rsquo;s successors, of the Ptolemies, and
the C&aelig;sars&mdash;all in gold, in the highest state of
preservation, and of most exquisite workmanship, (all but those
of the former part of Philip&rsquo;s reign, before he had become
master of Greece, and could command the service of its artists,)
and far exceeding the best of modern productions, except,
perhaps, those of <i>Thomas Simon</i>, and <i>Dossier</i>, which
come the nighest to the ancients.&nbsp; Many other curiosities
were to be found at Narborough, <a name="page172"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 172</span>and not the least among them was a
MS. copy of the <i>Eikon Bazilike</i>, one of the most perfect
specimens of fine penmanship extant, perhaps, on so large a
scale.&nbsp; The pages, the lines, and the letters, were uniform,
and exquisitely neat throughput.&nbsp; It was a quarto volume,
and said to be written, or transcribed by I. <span
class="smcap">Thomasen</span>, schoolmaster, at Tarvin, in the
county palatine of Chester.&nbsp; He was said to have written
three different copies, all in nearly equal perfection: of the
other two, one is deposited in the King&rsquo;s library, and the
other in the British Museum; but this was said to be the best the
three.&nbsp; To the best of this writer&rsquo;s recollection, Mr.
Tyssen said, that it cost him a hundred guineas, nor did he seem
to repent of his bargain.&nbsp; The price it fetched at the sale,
however, fell greatly short of that sum.&mdash;An ancient shield,
denoting and commemorating the taking of Carthage, was another of
the late curiosities of Narborough: it represented one of the
fair damsels of that devoted city, bearing the keys, and
delivering them to Scipio, followed by a long train of the
principal inhabitants, whose dejected and woeful looks, bespoke
the grief and anguish that had then overwhelmed the Carthaginian
nation.&mdash;Close to Narborough Hall is an old fortification,
the remains of an ancient encampment, called the burgh; from
whence to Oxburgh and Eastmore-fen, extends a large foss and
rampart, whose original designation seems not very easy to
discover.&mdash;In making a garden near the burgh, in 1600,
several human and pieces of armour were found.&nbsp; This place
is said to be peculiarly interesting to the antiquary; and it is
supposed that a small <a name="page173"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 173</span>Roman station was once established
here.&nbsp; John Brame, a monkish writer, in a manuscript
history, quoted by Spelman in his Icenia, says, that Narborough
was a British city, governed by an earl <i>Okenard</i>, about the
year 500, when it stood a seven months siege against a king
<i>Waldy</i>: but little reliance, however, can be placed on such
authority.&nbsp; In the adjoining parish of <i>Narford</i>,
numerous Roman bricks and other relics, are said to have been
found: also a large brass vase, or urn, was dug up in the court
yard of the manor house,</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Narford Hall</span>, the seat of Andrew
Fountaine Esq.&nbsp; It was erected in the reign of George I. by
the late Sir Andrew Fountaine, Knt. of whom some account will be
given in the next section.&nbsp; He was a great collector of
rarities, and made his house the repository of works of art and
learning.&nbsp; At present it is said to display a choice
collection of pictures, ancient painted earthenware, some
bronzes, coins, and a fine library of books, supposed to be the
best in the whole county.&nbsp; The room, in which these books
are deposited, is forty feet by twenty one; and contains, beside
the books, several Roman and Egyptian Vases, and portraits of
eminent men.&nbsp; This library seems not to have been collected
for mere ostentation.&nbsp; The original collector is said to
have been a man of letters, as well as a connoiseur and virtuoso,
and one, at least, of his successors has been reputed a literary
character, and a proficient in some branches, especially
<i>Spanish</i> literature; in which language the said library
contains many rare and valuable articles, one of which he
sometime ago <a name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
174</span>translated into English, and it has since made its
appearance from the Swaffham Press.</p>
<p>Several springs of mineral water, of the chalybeate kind, are
to be found in the neighbourhood of Lynn, on this eastern side;
of which one is at Riffley, and another on Gaywood common, both
within two miles of the town.&nbsp; There is also another beyond
Setchey, on the Downham road.&nbsp; There are others in East
Winch parish, one of which is much more strongly impregnated than
any of the rest, and might, perhaps, be ranked, in point of
medicinal virtue, with some of those springs that have acquired
so much celebrity as to become places of considerable
resort.&nbsp; This Spring is said to be strongly impregnated with
what chymists and mineralogists call sulphate of iron.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Section</span> IV.</h4>
<p class="gutsumm"><i>Biographical Sketches of some of the most
celebrated</i>, <i>or memorable persons who were natives of this
part of the country</i>.</p>
<p>Of all the eminent men who sprung up in this part of Norfolk,
the precedence seems unquestionably due to</p>
<p><i>Sir</i> <span class="smcap">Edward Coke</span>, the famous
Lord chief Justice.&nbsp; He was the son of Robert Coke, Esq. of
Mileham, where he was born in 1550, or as some say in 1549.&nbsp;
At ten years of age he was sent to the free <a
name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 175</span>school at
Norwich; and after having spent there a competent time, he was
removed to Trinity College in Cambridge, where he continued about
four years, and then went to Clifford&rsquo;s Inn, and the next
year was entered a student of the Inner Temple.&nbsp; He was
called to the bar at six years standing, which in that age was
held very extraordinary.&nbsp; Lloyd tells us that &ldquo;the
first occasion of his rise was his stating the Cook&rsquo;s case
of the Temple, that all the house, who were puzzled with it,
admired him; and his pleading it so, that the whole bench took
notice of him.&rdquo;&nbsp; His reputation increased very fast,
and he soon came into great practice.&nbsp; When he had been at
the bar about seven years, he married a lady of one of the best
families in his native county, and with a very large fortune for
that age.&nbsp; He now rose rapidly: the cities of Coventry and
Norwich chose him their Recorder; and he was engaged in all the
great causes in Westminster Hall.&nbsp; He was also in high
credit with Lord Burleigh and the other rulers, and often
consulted in state affairs.&nbsp; He became moreover, one of the
representatives of his native county in parliament, Speaker of
the House of Commons, and successively Solicitor-general,
Attorney-general, Lord Chief Justice of the Common Pleas, and
finally, Lord Chief Justice of England, or rather <i>of the
King&rsquo;s Bench</i>, as king James would have it called.&nbsp;
Sir Edward was a high spirited man, and on many occasions
discovered much firmness and integrity, even when the other
judges gave way, and the mandates of the Sovereign required a
different conduct.&nbsp; This kind of behaviour, in time,
rendered <a name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
176</span>him obnoxious to the Court, and brought upon him its
heavy displeasure, which issued in his expulsion from the Council
Table, and his removal from the office of Lord Chief Justice; the
king declaring, &ldquo;That he was for a tyrant the fittest
instrument that ever was in England.&rdquo;&nbsp; He afterward
joined the country party, and made a distinguished figure among
the great parliamentary patriots, in the latter part of the reign
of James and the former part of that of Charles I.&nbsp; He died
at his house at Stoke Pogey, in Buckinghamshire, Sept. 3, 1634,
in the 86 year of his age, and expired with these words in his
mouth, &ldquo;Thy kingdom come, thy will be done.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
was one of the greatest Lawyers that England ever produced.&nbsp;
He had quick parts, a deep penetration, a retentive memory, and a
solid judgement.&nbsp; He was greatly honoured and esteemed among
his brethren of the long robe; and when persecuted by the Court,
and a brief was given against him to Sir John Walter, that
gentleman, though Attorney-general to the prince, laid aside the
brief, with this remarkable sentence, &ldquo;Let my tongue cleave
to the roof of my mouth, whenever I open it against Sir Edward
Coke.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was observed to make a better figure in
adversity than in prosperity; and he was so good at making the
best of a disgrace, that king James said, &ldquo;Let them throw
him which way they would, he always fell upon his
legs.&rdquo;&nbsp; He valued himself, and not without reason,
upon this, that he obtained all his preferments without employing
either prayers or pence, and that he became Speaker of the House
of Commons, Solicitor-general, Attorney-general, Chief Justice of
both Benches, High Steward of Cambridge, <a
name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 177</span>and a
member of the Privy Council, without either begging or
bribing.&nbsp; In this he was very different from many of his
most eminent cotemporaries, and especially from his great and
celebrated rival Bacon, who was remarkable for the meanness with
which he used to solicit preferment.&nbsp; He was in his person
well proportioned, and his features were regular.&nbsp; He was
neat, but not nice, in his dress; and would say, that &ldquo;the
cleanness of a man&rsquo;s clothes ought to put him in mind of
keeping all clean within.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was twice married, but
his second marriage proved unhappy.&nbsp; He left behind him a
numerous issue, as well as a large fortune; and may be ranked
among the greatest men of his time. <a name="citation177a"></a><a
href="#footnote177a" class="citation">[177a]</a></p>
<p>In the latter part of his life he appears to have been among
the reputed <i>Jacobins</i> of that day, [as is also said to have
been the case, in the estimation of some <i>wise</i> and
<i>virtuous</i> people, <a name="citation177b"></a><a
href="#footnote177b" class="citation">[177b]</a> with his present
descendant of Holkham, during the late memorable reign and rage
of our furious alarmists.]&nbsp; While he lay upon his death-bed,
his house was, by an order of council, searched for seditions and
dangerous papers: and the searchers took <a
name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 178</span>away his
commentary upon Magna Charta; his commentary upon Lyttleton, with
the history of his Life before it, written with his own hand; the
Pleas of the Crown; and the Jurisdiction of Courts; his 11th. and
12th. Reports, in MS; with 51 other MSS; together with his Last
Will and Testament, which contained the provision he had been
making for his younger grandchildren.&nbsp; These papers were
kept from the family for several years, and the Will was never
heard of more. <a name="citation178"></a><a href="#footnote178"
class="citation">[178]</a></p>
<p>2.&nbsp; <i>Sir</i> <span class="smcap">Henry
Spelman</span>.&nbsp; He was born at Congham, in 1561, or
1562.&nbsp; Before he was fifteen he was sent to Trinity College,
in Cambridge; but his father dying in about two years and half
after, he was taken home by his mother to assist her in managing
the affairs of the family.&nbsp; About a year after, he was sent
to Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn to study the law, where having continued
almost three years, he retired into the country, and married a
Lady of good family and fortune.&nbsp; Beside his own rural and
domestic concerns, which now demanded and employed the chief of
his attention, he was also very assiduous to improve himself in
the knowledge of the Constitution, Laws and Antiquities of his
Country.&nbsp; He was early admitted a member of the Society of
Antiquaries, <a name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
179</span>which brought him into an intimate acquaintance with
Sir Robert Cotton, Camden, and others of the most eminent men for
that kind of literature.&nbsp; In 1604, he was appointed High
Sheriff of Norfolk, and about the same time wrote a description
of that county, which he communicated to <i>Speed</i>: but it was
not the first book he wrote: a book on Heraldry, and another on
the Coins of the kingdom, he had before written; and perhaps
more.&nbsp; In 1607, the king nominated him one of the
Commissioners for determining the unsettled titles of lands and
manors in Ireland; on which occasion he went thither several
times, and discharged the trust reposed in him with great
reputation.&nbsp; He was also appointed one of the Commissioners
to enquire into the oppression of exacted fees in all courts and
offices, as well ecclesiastical as civil; which gave rise to his
treatise <i>De Sepultura</i>, or of the Burial Fees, in which he
made it evident, that most part of the fees exacted by the clergy
and church officers, on account of funerals, is no better than
gross imposition.&nbsp; His close attention to those public
employments proved prejudicial to his family and circumstances;
in consideration of which the government made him a present of
300<i>l</i>, till something better could be done for him.&nbsp;
His majesty also conferred on him the honour of knighthood,
which, however, did probably impoverish rather than enrich
him.&nbsp; His majesty did what was still worse, in prohibiting
the Meetings of the Antiquarian Society, lest, forsooth, they
might be led to treat of <i>state affairs</i>! <a
name="citation179"></a><a href="#footnote179"
class="citation">[179]</a>&nbsp; <a name="page180"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 180</span>His wise majesty seemed conscious
that those affairs were too brittle to be handled, and too foul
to be exposed to open daylight.&nbsp; When about fifty he went to
reside in London, and gave himself up to archaiological
studies.&nbsp; He collected all such books and MSS. as he could
find of that description, whether foreign or domestic.&nbsp; In
1626, he published the first part of his well known
<i>Glossary</i>, which he never carried beyond the letter L,
because, as some have suggested, he had said things under
<i>Magna Charta</i>, and <i>Maximum Concilium</i>, that could not
then have appeared without giving offence.&nbsp; He wrote many
things, most of which are still held in considerable
repute.&nbsp; He died in 1641: his posthumous works were
published in 1698, in folio, under the inspection of bishop
Gibson.&nbsp; At his death his papers came into the hands of his
eldest Son,</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; <i>Sir</i> <span class="smcap">John Spelman</span>,
&ldquo;the heir of his studies,&rdquo; as he himself calls him,
who was also a very learned man, and had great encouragement and
assurance of favour from Charles I.&nbsp; That prince one time
sent for Sir Henry Spelman, and offered him the mastership of
Sutton Hospital, with some other advantages, in consideration of
his good services both to church and state.&nbsp; He returned his
majesty thanks, and told him that he was very old, and had now
one foot in the grave, and should therefore be more obliged if he
would consider his son.&nbsp; Upon which the king sent for Mr.
Spelman, and conferred both the mastership of the Hospital and
the honour of knighthood upon him; and he afterwards employed him
to draw up several papers in vindication <a
name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 181</span>of the
proceedings of the court.&nbsp; He published the Saxon Psalter
under the title of <i>Psalterium Davidis Latino-Saxonicum
vetus</i>, in 1640, in quarto, from a MS in his father&rsquo;s
Library, collated with three other copies.&nbsp; He also wrote
&ldquo;The Life of King Alfred the Great,&rdquo; in English;
which was translated into Latin, sometime after the Restoration,
by Mr. Christopher Wase, superior Beadle of the Civil Law at
Oxford; which translation, with notes and cuts by Mr. Obadiah
Walker Master of University College, was published, from the
Theatre Press, in 1679, in folio.&nbsp; The original English was
also published from the same press, by Mr. Thomas Hearne, in
1709. 8vo.&nbsp; Sir John Spelman died in 1643.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; <i>Sir</i> <span class="smcap">Roger
L&rsquo;Estrange</span> is another of the notable natives of this
part of the county.&nbsp; He was the youngest son of Sir Hamon
L&rsquo;Estrange, Bart. of Hunstanton Hall, where he was born
Dec. 17, 1616.&nbsp; He received a liberal education, which he is
supposed to have completed at Cambridge.&nbsp; His father being a
zealous royalist, took care to instil the same principles in his
son, which the latter eagerly embraced; and in 1639, he attended
the king, in his expedition into Scotland.&nbsp; His attachment
to the royal cause became now very strong; and sometime after
nearly cost him his life: for in 1644, soon after the Earl of
Manchester had reduced Lynn to the authority of the Parliament,
young L&rsquo;Estrange, thinking he had some interest in the
place, as his father had been governor of it, formed a scheme for
surprising it; and received a commission from the king,
constituting him is governor, in <a name="page182"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 182</span>case of success: but his design
being betrayed by two of his confederates, (named <i>Leman</i>
and <i>Haggar</i>,) though both bound under an oath of secresy,
he was seized, tried, and, by a court-martial, condemned to die,
as a traitor.&nbsp; While he lay in prison, he was visited by Mr.
Arrowsmith, and Mr. Thorowgood, two of the assembly of divines,
who very kindly offered him their utmost interest, if he would
make some petitionary acknowledgement, and submit to take the
covenant, but he refused.&nbsp; After thirty months spent in vain
endeavours, either to have a hearing, or to be put into an
exchangeable condition, he printed a state of his case, by way of
appeal from the court martial (by which he had been tried) to the
Parliament.&nbsp; About the time of the Kentish insurrection, in
1648, he escaped out of prison, with the keeper&rsquo;s privity,
as he himself says, and went into Kent, and retiring to the house
of Mr Hales, a young gentleman, heir to a great estate in that
county, he spirited him up to head the insurrection; but that
design failed of success.&nbsp; After this miscarriage, he
escaped beyond sea, where he continued till the autumn of 1653;
when taking his opportunity, in the change of government, upon
Cromwell&rsquo;s dissolution of the long parliament, he returned
into England, and having an opportunity to speak to Cromwell, and
obtaining a favourable hearing, he escaped any further trouble,
and shortly after received his discharge, by an order dated 31.
Oct. 1653.&nbsp; How he spent his time for the next six or seven
years does not appear; but it may be presumed that he remained
pretty quiet, and avoided all interference with political, or
state affairs.&nbsp; He is said <a name="page183"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 183</span>to have sometimes played before the
Protector on the bass viol, for which he was by some called
<i>Oliver&rsquo;s fidler</i>.&nbsp; After the Restoration he was
little noticed, either by the king or his ministers, for
sometime; which he very much resented.&nbsp; Afterward, however,
he was appointed to a profitable, but odious office, that of
<i>Licencer of the Press</i>; which he held till a little before
the Revolution.&nbsp; In 1663 he set up a newspaper, called
&ldquo;The Public Intelligencer and the News,&rdquo; which was
afterwards put down by the <i>London</i> <span
class="smcap">Gazette</span>; for which, however, government
allowed him a consideration.&nbsp; After the popish plot, when
the Tories began to gain the ascendant over the Whigs, he, in a
paper called <i>the Observator</i>, became a zealous champion for
the former, and an advocate for some of the worst measures of the
Court.&nbsp; He was afterward knighted, and served in the
parliament called by James II. in 1685.&nbsp; After the
Revolution he met with some trouble, as a disaffected
person.&nbsp; He is said to have been particularly disliked by
the queen, who very curiously anagrammed his name, as was
mentioned in the first section of this chapter.&nbsp; He died on
the 11th. of September 1704, in the 88th. year of his age, and
was interred in the church of St. Giles in the fields, where
there is an inscription to his memory.&nbsp; He wrote many
political tracts, in a high tory strain, and often with little
regard to truth; and also published translations of
Josephus&rsquo;s works, Cicero&rsquo;s offices, Seneca&rsquo;s
morals, Erasmus&rsquo;s colloquies, Esop&rsquo;s fables,
Quevedo&rsquo;s visions, &amp;c.&nbsp; His style has been praised
by some, while others have represented it as intolerably <a
name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 184</span>low and
nauseous: and Granger represents him as one of the great
corrupters of our language.&nbsp; But there was something in his
character that was still worse and more detestable than even his
style.&mdash;Having mentioned him as one of our early compilers
of newspapers, it may not be amiss here just to note, that he had
been long preceded in that occupation, by a country-man of his,
<i>Wm. Watts</i>, M.A. who is supposed to have been the very
first compiler of a weekly, or stated English newspaper; at least
his employer, <i>Butter</i>, seems to have been the first editor
of such a paper, which was begun in August 1622, under the name
of &ldquo;The certain news of this present week;&rdquo; and Watts
is thought to have been the compiler of it from the first, and is
therefore deemed the <i>Gallo-Belgicus</i> of England: alluding
to the first newspaper, or periodical publication of the low
Countries, about the beginning of the 17th century, which went by
that name.&nbsp; But as Watts is said to have been a native of
Lynn, a further account of him shall be given in its proper
place.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; <i>Sir</i> <span class="smcap">Robert Walpole</span>,
afterward Earl of Orford.&nbsp; He was born at Houghton, in
1674.&nbsp; In 1700, he was chosen member of Parliament for Lynn,
which he also represented in many succeeding parliaments.&nbsp;
In 1705 he was made one of the council to Prince George of
Denmark, as lord high admiral.&nbsp; In 1707 he was made
secretary at war; and in 1709 treasurer of the navy.&nbsp; On the
change of the ministry, the year following, he was removed from
all his places, and in 1711 was voted by the house of commons
guilty of notorious <a name="page185"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 185</span>corruption, in his office as
secretary at war: it was therefore resolved that he should be
committed to the tower, and expelled the house.&nbsp; But being
considered by the whigs as a kind of martyr to their cause, the
borough of Lynn rechose him, and though the house declared his
election void, yet the electors persisted in their choice, and he
sat in the next parliament.&nbsp; On the accession of George I.
he was appointed paymaster-general of the forces, and a privy
counsellor; but in a disagreement, two years after, with Mr.
Secretary Stanhope, he resigned, turned patriot, of course, and
opposed the ministry.&nbsp; Early in 1720 he was again made
pay-master of the forces, and the complaisance of the courtier
began once more to appear: nor was it long before he acquired
full ministerial power, as first lord of the treasury and
chancellor of the exchequer.&nbsp; The measures of his
administration, during the long course of his premiership, have
been often canvassed, with all the severity of critical inquiry,
and variously determined.&nbsp; Though he has been called the
father of corruption, and is said to have boasted, that he knew
every man&rsquo;s price, yet the opposition prevailed over him in
1742, and obliged him to resign.&nbsp; He was screened from any
further resentment of the house of commons, by a peerage, being
created Earl of Orford, and gratified with a pension of
4000<i>l</i> a year.&nbsp; He is generally allowed to have been a
minister of considerable talents, and a notable manager of
parliaments.&nbsp; Whatever were his faults, and he doubtless had
many, he was evidently a <i>man of peace</i>, and <i>no war
minister</i>, <a name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
186</span>which ought to endear his memory to posterity.&nbsp;
Had his successors, and particularly the late minister
<i>Pitt</i>, been more of his disposition in that respect, it had
probably, at this time, been a happy circumstance for the British
empire, if not also for some other nations.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; <i>Sir</i> <span class="smcap">Andrew
Fountaine</span>.&nbsp; He was born at <i>Narford</i>, and
educated at Christ Church, Oxford, where he studied the
Anglo-Saxon language, of his skill in which he afterward gave
good proof, by a piece inserted in Dr Hicks&rsquo;s Thesaurus,
entitled, &ldquo;Numismata Anglo-Saxonica, et Anglo-danica,
breviter illustrata ab Andre&acirc; Fountaine eq. aur. et
&aelig;d. Christi Oxon alumno, 1705.&rdquo;&nbsp; King William
conferred on him the honour of knighthood: and he was afterwards,
it seems, in 1726, made knight of the Bath, by patent; at which
time he was Vice Chamberlain to the princess of Wales.&nbsp; He
travelled for a considerable time in various parts of Europe, and
is said to have made a noble collection of antiques and
curiosities; of his adventures in the meantime, not all over and
above delicate or reputable, some curious anecdotes are still
remembered.&nbsp; In 1709 he drew the designs for the Tale of a
Tub, by Swift, with whom he is said to have been very intimate,
as well as with Pope, who complimented him for the elegance of
his taste.&nbsp; In 1727 he was appointed Warden of the Mint,
which office be held till his death, in 1753.&nbsp; He was
reputed an eminent connoisseur, virtuoso, and antiquary; and
Narford Hall owes to him most, if not the whole of its boasted
curiosities.</p>
<p><a name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
187</span>7.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Martin Folkes</span>, Esq.
much distinguished in his time as a philosopher and antiquary,
was the eldest Son of a Barrister of the same name, by one of the
two daughters and coheiresses of Sir Wm. Hovell of Hillington
Hall; which accounts for the estate of the Hovells descending to
him.&nbsp; He was born in 1690, at Westminster, where his father
then resided.&nbsp; His education, which is supposed to have
commenced at Westminster school, was finished at Cambridge, where
his proficiency appears to have been very considerable.&nbsp; He
became a member of the Royal Society in his 23rd year.&nbsp;
About ten years after, he was appointed vice president of the
same Society, to which he had been nominated by Sir Isaac Newton,
the then President.&nbsp; He was also a member of the Society of
Antiquaries.&nbsp; On the resignation of Sir Hans Sloane, in
1741, be was elected President of the R.S. and not long after he
was nominated one of the eight foreign members of the Academy of
Sciences at Paris.&nbsp; He died in 1754, and is said to have
been a person of very extensive knowledge and great
respectability; and in his private character polite, generous,
and friendly.&nbsp; His principal service to science was his
elucidation of the intricate subject of coins, weights, and
measures.&nbsp; Though he had daughters of his own, he left the
seat and estate of his maternal ancestors, the Hovells, to his
brother, whose Son, Sir Martin Browne Folkes, bart. M.P. is their
present possessor.</p>
<p>8.&nbsp; <i>The honourable</i> <span class="smcap">Horace
Walpole</span>, afterward <i>Earl of Orford</i>.&nbsp; He was the
youngest Son of the celebrated <a name="page188"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 188</span>Sir Robert Walpole, and born about
the year 1717.&nbsp; In 1739 he set out upon his travels,
accompanied by his friend <i>Gray</i>, the poet: but they
afterward quarrelled and separated.&nbsp; In the parliament of
1741 he was a member for Collington; in that of 1747, for Castle
Rising; and in those of 1754 and 1761, for Lynn.&nbsp; At the
expiration of the latter parliament he retired from business, and
attached himself wholly to literary pursuits, residing chiefly,
if not wholly, at Strawberry Hill, in Surrey, where he had a
private printing-office, for the purpose of having his
productions edited under his own eye.&nbsp; His principal works
are The Catalogue of Royal and Noble Authors, and The Historic
Doubts respecting the character, conduct, and person of Richard
III.&nbsp; He wrote also The Mysterious Mother, Castle of
Otranto, and other works, which are considered as proofs of his
being a person of very extensive reading, and of eminent genius
and talents.&nbsp; On the death of his nephew he succeeded to the
family title and estates; but did not long enjoy them.&nbsp; He
died in 1797.</p>
<p>9.&nbsp; <i>Admiral</i> <span class="smcap">Horatio
Nelson</span>, afterward <i>Sir</i> <span class="smcap">Horatio
Nelson</span>, and latterly, <i>Lord Viscount Nelson</i>, and
<i>Duke of Bronte</i> in the kingdom of Naples.&nbsp; He was the
4th Son of the Rev. Edward Nelson, rector of Burnham Thorpe,
where he was born September 29, 1758.&nbsp; He is said to have
been maternally related to the Walpoles and the Townshends, two
of the first families in his native county.&nbsp; He was sent
early to sea, under the care of a relation, who was a captain in
the navy, where he soon distinguished himself, and became in <a
name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 189</span>time one of
the greatest naval commanders that this or any other country ever
produced.&nbsp; His most renowned achievements were those at
<i>Aboukir</i>, <i>Copenhagen</i>, and <i>Trafalgar</i>; the
latter of which he did not survive, being killed by a musket
ball, near the close of the engagement, which terminated in one
of the most complete and decisive victories ever recorded in the
annals of naval warfare.&nbsp; He arrived at high pre-eminence,
through deeds of blood, and a vast destruction of his species,
which can have no place among the christian virtues.&nbsp; But
his biography and character are too well known to need being here
further enlarged upon. <a name="citation189"></a><a
href="#footnote189" class="citation">[189]</a></p>
<p>10.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">William Bewley</span> was for
many years a most distinguished character among the inhabitants
of this part of Norfolk.&nbsp; He was not a native of this
country, but came hither, it is thought, from the north of
England, about 1749, and settled at Great Massingham, as a
surgeon and apothecary, where he continued for the remainder of
his days, greatly respected as a professional man, but more
especially so as a <i>philosopher</i>, in which character he was
thought inferior to few, if any, of his cotemporaries.&nbsp; With
some of the most enlightened of them he was held in high and
deserved estimation.&nbsp; Dr. <i>Burney</i> and Dr.
<i>Priestley</i> were of that number; the latter of whom he very
materially assisted in his experimental pursuits, and was the
first who discovered and suggested to him the acidity of mephitic
or fixed air.&nbsp; Intimate as these two philosophers appear to
have been, they were in some respects, <a
name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 190</span>it seems,
of very different sentiments.&nbsp; Priestley was an admirer of
<i>Hartley</i>, and a decided materialist, while Bewley, on the
other hand, was a disciple of <i>Berkeley</i>, and a firm
believer of the ideal system.&nbsp; Between these two systems
there is evidently a very striking contrast; yet that occasioned
no breach in their friendship, or any coolness or abatement in
their esteem for each other.&nbsp; Among theologians, and minor
philosophers, much slighter differences might have occasioned (as
they generally do) endless jarrings, and an irreconcileable
antipathy; but Priestley and Bewley were men of another, and a
very different cast, and knew how to entertain the purest
friendship for each other, while they held, on some important
points, very dissimilar, and even opposite opinions.&nbsp; Their
friendship commenced about the time that Priestley published his
History of Electricity.&nbsp; Bewley&rsquo;s critique upon that
work, in the Monthly Review, was the means, as the Dr. says, of
opening a correspondence between them, which was the source of
much satisfaction to him, as long as Mr. Bewley lived.&nbsp; The
Dr. used instantly to communicate to him an account of every new
experiment that he made, and in return was favoured with his
remarks upon them.&nbsp; All that Bewley published of his own
(except those articles which he furnished for the Monthly Review)
were papers inserted in the Dr&rsquo;s. volumes <i>on Air</i>,
all of which, says the doctor, are ingenious and valuable.&nbsp;
Always publishing in that manner, he used to call himself <i>Dr.
Priestley&rsquo;s Satellite</i>.&nbsp; There was a vein of
pleasant wit and humour (as the Dr. informs us) in all his
correspondence, which added greatly to <a
name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 191</span>the value
of it.&nbsp; His Letters to the Dr. would have made several
volumes, and the Dr&rsquo;s to him, still more.&nbsp; He was in
his latter years a valetudinarian of a very sickly
appearance.&nbsp; When he found himself dangerously ill, and his
dissolution fast approaching, he made a point of paying the Dr. a
visit before he died.&nbsp; He accordingly made a journey from
Massingham to Birmingham, for that purpose, accompanied by Mrs.
Bewley: and after spending about a week there, he went to pay
another last or parting visit to his friend Dr. Burney, and
there, at his house in St. Martin&rsquo;s Street, London, he
died, on the 5th. of Sept. 1783.&nbsp; He was for many years one
of the writers of the Monthly Review, and the articles he
furnished for that respectable publication were thought not
inferior to the productions of the very ablest of his
associates.&nbsp; How many articles he furnished for that work is
not known, except, perhaps, to the Editor.&nbsp; The review of
<span class="smcap"><i>Priestley&rsquo;s</i></span><i> History of
Electricity</i>, (as was before observed,) of <span
class="smcap"><i>Whitehurst&rsquo;s</i></span><i> Inquiry into
the original State and formation of the Earth</i>, and of <i>Sir
</i><span class="smcap"><i>John Hawkins&rsquo;</i></span><i>
History of Music</i>, are understood to have been drawn up by Mr.
Bewley.&nbsp; The last mentioned article is said to have been
much admired at the time by the late celebrated Dr. <i>Samuel
Johnson</i>.&nbsp; Mr. Bewley was sometimes denominated <i>The
Philosopher of Massingham</i>, and with as much propriety, it was
supposed, as <i>Hobbes</i> was styled <i>The Philosopher of
Malmsbury</i>.&nbsp; The branches of knowledge in which he was
said chiefly to excel were those of <i>Anatomy</i>,
<i>Electricity</i>, and <i>Chemistry</i>.&nbsp; <a
name="page192"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 192</span>He had
naturally a fine ear, and was particularly fond of music; and was
not only an excellent judge of composition, but also a good
performer on the violin.&nbsp; He cultivated the art and science
of music as a relief from severer pursuits, and applied to it in
the hours of relaxation, with that ardour which characterized all
his undertakings.&nbsp; A love for every liberal science and an
insatiable curiosity after whatever was connected with them, were
his predominant passions.&nbsp; So strongly and lastingly did
they operate, that he desired some books might be brought to him
on the very evening before he died, when the excruciating pains
of his disorder had a little abated; and though unable to read
himself, he listened to what was read, and drank in knowledge
with his wonted eagerness, and,</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;&ldquo;with
his latest breath<br />
Thus shewed his ruling passion strong in death.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He was a remarkably warm friend, and an excellent husband: and
withal of so benevolent and peculiar a turn of mind, that he
would not willingly hurt a worm; nor would he, it seems, cut a
living twig from a shrub or tree, because he did not know, (as he
would say) but the operation might occasion pain.&nbsp; Many will
probably affect to smile at this, under an idea of their own
fancied superiority, whose characters, nevertheless, would bear
no comparison with that of William Bewley, not to say as
<i>scholars</i>, and <i>philosophers</i>, but even as <i>men</i>,
and <i>members of society</i>.&nbsp; In short, he appears to have
been a very <i>good</i>, as well as a very wise and great man. <a

<p class="gutsumm"><i>Of the </i><span
class="smcap"><i>Animals</i></span>, <i>and particularly the
</i><span class="smcap"><i>Birds</i></span><i> of this
country</i>.</p>
<p><i>Sir Thomas Browne</i> seems to have placed the <span
class="smcap">Spermaceti-Whale</span> among the animals of
Norfolk.&nbsp; One of them sixty two feet in length, was taken,
as he says, near Wells.&nbsp; Another of the same kind, (he adds)
about twenty years after, was caught at Hunstanton; and not far
from thence, eight or nine were driven ashore, two of which were
said to have young ones, after they had forsaken the water.</p>
<p>The <span class="smcap">Porpesse</span>, the <span
class="smcap">Dolphin</span>, and the <span
class="smcap"><i>Grampus</i></span>, are also, by the same
writer, numbered among the Norfolk animals.&nbsp; The flesh of
the two former, he represents as good food, especially that of
the Dolphin, which when well-cooked, he says, is generally
allowed to be a good dish.&nbsp; But it is very rarely that one
meets with any that have tasted of it.</p>
<p>As to the <span class="smcap">Common Seal</span> or
<i>Sea-Calf</i>, being an amphibious creature, it is not so
unnaturally classed among land animals.&nbsp; Numbers of them are
often found sleeping on the shore and the sand-banks, below Lynn;
while one, as is said, is keeping watch in the meantime, lest his
companions be caught napping, and to apprise them of the approach
of danger; in which case, they all instantly rush into the deep
and disappear.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Otters</span> also are not uncommon in
this country.&nbsp; The young ones, says Sir T. Browne, are
sometimes, preyed upon by buzzards, having occasionally been
found in <a name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
194</span>the nests of these birds.&nbsp; By many persons they
are accounted no bad dish, as he says; and he adds, that Otters
may be rendered perfectly tame, and in some houses have been
known to serve the office of turnspits.</p>
<p>To the foregoing animals may be added <i>Badgers</i>,
<i>Hares</i>, and <i>Rabbits</i>.&nbsp; The latter are here more
numerous than in most other parts of the kingdom, and yet not so
numerous it seems as they have been, owing to modern agricultural
improvements.&nbsp; Hares are also in general pretty plentiful
here in most places, and the game-laws very strictly enforced, as
many a poacher knows to his cost.</p>
<p>The different Species of <span class="smcap">Birds</span>
found in this country, including the <i>water-fowl</i>, are very
numerous.&nbsp; The following List includes the chief of them,
and is taken mostly from Sir Thomas Browne&rsquo;s Paper inserted
in the 20th volume of the Monthly Magazine.&nbsp; 1. The
<i>Sea</i> or <i>Fen</i> <span class="smcap">Eagle</span>.&nbsp;
Some of this species are said to be so large as to measure three
yards and a quarter in the extent of their wings, and are capable
of being perfectly tamed, and will feed on fish, red herrings,
flesh, or any kind of offal.&nbsp; 2. The <span
class="smcap">Osprey</span>, which hovers about the fens, and
will dip his claws into the water, and often take up a fish, and
likewise catch <i>Coots</i>.&nbsp; It is sometime called the
<i>bald-buzzard</i>.&nbsp; 3. The <span
class="smcap">Kite</span>.&nbsp; This species is said not to be
very numerous.&nbsp; 4. The <span class="smcap">Merlin</span>, or
<i>Hobby-bird</i>: said to be subject to the vertigo, and
sometimes caught in those fits.&nbsp; 5. The <span
class="smcap">Woodchat</span>, or <i>bird-catcher</i>; a small
bird of prey about the size of a thrush.&nbsp; 6. The <span
class="smcap">Raven</span>.&nbsp; 7. The <a
name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 195</span><span
class="smcap">Rook</span>.&nbsp; 8. The <span
class="smcap">Jackdaw</span>.&nbsp; 9. The <span
class="smcap">Roller</span>: a very uncommon bird.&nbsp; 10. The
<span class="smcap">Cuckoo</span>.&nbsp; 11, 12, 13, 14. The
<span class="smcap">Green Woodpecker</span>; The <span
class="smcap">greater spotted Woodpecker</span>; The <span
class="smcap">Middle Spotted Woodpecker</span>; and the <span
class="smcap">Nuthatch</span>.&nbsp; 15. The <span
class="smcap">Kingfisher</span>.&nbsp; 16. The <span
class="smcap">Hoopoe</span>, or <i>Hoope-bird</i>, so called from
its note. 17, 18, 19.&nbsp; The <span
class="smcap">Skylark</span>, <span
class="smcap">Woodlark</span>, and <span
class="smcap">Titlark</span>.&nbsp; These are very common; but
another, called <i>the great crested lark</i>, it seems, is not
so.&nbsp; 20. The <span class="smcap">Stares</span>, or <span
class="smcap">Starlings</span>, are in vast, and almost
incredible numbers about the fens, where they roost at night,
about the autumn on the reeds and alders, from whence they take
their flight in the morning like thick clouds.&nbsp; The rooks,
though very numerous in some parts of the kingdom, are never any
where seen in such flocks as these birds are about the
fens.&nbsp; 21. The <span class="smcap">Hawfinch</span>.&nbsp;
This bird is chiefly seen in summer, about cherry time; and is
said to feed on the kernels of cherries and some other kinds of
stone fruit; and by means of its amazingly strong bill it breaks
the stone without much difficulty.&nbsp; 22. The <span
class="smcap">Waxen Chatterer</span>; which is said to be a very
beautiful bird, but now a more uncommon bird than formerly.&nbsp;
23. The <span class="smcap">Crossbill</span>; is migratory, and
arrives about the beginning of Summer.&nbsp; 24. The <span
class="smcap">Gold-finch</span>, otherwise <i>Fools-coat</i> or
<i>Draw-water</i>.&nbsp; 25. The <span
class="smcap">Wheatear</span>.&nbsp; These breed in rabbit
burrows, and warrens are full of them from April to
September.&nbsp; They are caught with a hobby and a net, and are
accounted excellent eating.&nbsp; 26. The <span
class="smcap">Goat-sucker</span>, or <i>Dorhawk</i>, so called
from the circumstance of its feeding on dors, or beetles.&nbsp;
It breeds <a name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
196</span>here and lays a very handsome spotted egg.&nbsp; [It
flies about later than most other birds except the owl; and while
perching in the evening on a tree, it makes a noise somewhat like
the croaking of frogs, or rather the twirling of a spinning
wheel, from which it has in some parts been called, <i>The
Spinner</i>.]&nbsp; 27. The <span
class="smcap">Bustard</span>.&nbsp; A writer whose signature is
X. P. S. in the 20th volume of the Monthly Magazine, says that
&ldquo;the bustards are at this time all extirpated out of
Norfolk;&rdquo; but he is certainly mistaken: they are still to
be found in the open parts of the country, but not so frequently
as formerly.&nbsp; They become more and more rare; and they will,
perhaps, be soon extirpated; but it is not the case yet.&nbsp;
The bustard is the largest of British birds, and is remarkable
(says Sir Thomas Browne) for the strength of its breast-bone, and
for its short heel.&nbsp; It lays two eggs which are much bigger
than those of a turkey, as the bustard itself is also larger, as
well as handsomer than that bird.&nbsp; It is accounted a dainty
dish, and those who have eaten it, speak much in its
praise.&nbsp; This famous bird seems incapable of being tamed or
domesticated. <a name="citation196"></a><a href="#footnote196"
class="citation">[196]</a>&nbsp; 28. and 29. <span
class="smcap">Black</span> and <span class="smcap">Red
game</span>, now unknown here.&nbsp; Some of the latter, or
grouse, were found, it seems, about Lynn, in Sir Thomas
Browne&rsquo;s time.&nbsp; 30. 31. <span
class="smcap"><i>Partridge</i></span> and <span
class="smcap">Quail</span> are here in great numbers.&nbsp; 32.
The <span class="smcap"><i>Corncrake</i></span>, or <span
class="smcap">Rayle</span> is also commonly found here.&nbsp; 33.
The <span class="smcap">Spoonbill</span>, now but seldom <a
name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 197</span>found here,
though formerly, it seems, pretty common.&nbsp; 34. The <span
class="smcap">Crane</span>, was formerly common here, but now
scarcely deemed a British bird.&nbsp; 35. The <span
class="smcap">White Stork</span>, now rarely seen, though
formerly not so uncommon a bird.&nbsp; 36. The <span
class="smcap">Heron</span> still abounds here.&nbsp; 37. The
<span class="smcap">Bittern</span>, or <i>Bitour</i>, is also
very common: both this and the preceding are deemed good
dishes.&nbsp; 38. The <span class="smcap">Godwit</span> or
<i>Yarwhelp</i>, is very common in Marshland, and deemed a dainty
dish.&nbsp; It frequents the sea shore and salt marshes in
winter, and the fens and interior parts in summer.&nbsp; 39. 40.
The <span class="smcap">Redshank</span>, and <span
class="smcap">Curlew</span>, are not unfrequent in the marshes
and about the sea coast.&nbsp; 41. The <span
class="smcap">Gnat</span> or <span
class="smcap">Knot</span>.&nbsp; This is a small bird, but is at
times very fat, and in much request for the table.&nbsp; They are
caught with nets.&nbsp; 42. The <span
class="smcap">Lapwing</span> is common here on all the heaths,
and in other parts.&nbsp; 43. The <span
class="smcap">Ruff</span>: so called from the feathers of the
neck projecting like a ruff.&nbsp; This is a marsh bird, and
varies greatly in its colours; no two of them are found
alike.&nbsp; The female is smaller than the male, has no ruff
about the neck, and is called a <i>Reeve</i>.&nbsp; It is very
seldom seen.&nbsp; The males when put together will fight most
bloodily and destroy each other.&nbsp; They lose their ruffs
towards the end of autumn, or beginning of winter.&nbsp; They are
very handsome birds.&nbsp; 44. The <span
class="smcap">Dotterel</span>, is a bird of passage; comes in
September and March, and is accounted excellent eating.&nbsp; 45.
<span class="smcap">King Dotterel</span>, or <i>Fen Dotterel</i>:
somewhat less, but better coloured than the former.&nbsp; 46. The
<span class="smcap">Stone Curlew</span>, is a tall handsome bird,
remarkably eyed.&nbsp; It is said to be so common in this
country, as to have <a name="page198"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 198</span>the name of the Norfolk
plover.&nbsp; 47. The <span class="smcap">Avoset</span>, or
<i>skooping horn</i>, is a tall, black and white bird, with a
bill semicircularly bent upwards.&nbsp; It is a summer bird, and
not unfrequent in Marshland.&nbsp; 48. The <span
class="smcap">Oyster Catcher</span> or <i>Sea-pie</i>.&nbsp; 49.
The Common Coote.&nbsp; These birds are frequently observed in
great flocks on broad waters, said to be remarkable for their
dexterous-defence of themselves and young, against kites and
buzzards.&nbsp; 50. 51. The <span class="smcap">Moor</span>, or
<span class="smcap">Water-hen</span>, and <span
class="smcap">Water-Raile</span>.&nbsp; 52. The <span
class="smcap">Wild Swan</span>, or <span
class="smcap">Elke</span>.&nbsp; It is probable they come from
great distances, for all the northern travellers are said to have
observed them in the remotest parts.&nbsp; Like other northern
birds, if the winter be mild they usually come no further south
than Scotland, if very hard they proceed onward till they arrive
in a country sufficiently warm.&nbsp; 53. 54. 55. <span
class="smcap"><i>Barnacle-goose</i></span>, <span
class="smcap"><i>Brent-goose</i></span>, and <span
class="smcap">Sheldrake</span>.&nbsp; The two former are common;
and the latter pretty much so, especially about Norrold, where
they are said to breed in rabbit-burrows.&nbsp; 56. 57. 58. 59.
60. The <span class="smcap"><i>Shoveler</i></span>, <span
class="smcap"><i>Pintail</i></span>, or <i>Sea-pheasant</i>,
<span class="smcap"><i>Garganey</i></span>, or <i>Teal</i>, <span
class="smcap"><i>Wild-goose</i></span>, and <span
class="smcap"><i>Gosander</i></span>, <i>or Mirganser</i>, are
all found in this country.&nbsp; 61. The <span
class="smcap"><i>Dun-diver</i></span>, or <i>Saw billed
diver</i>.&nbsp; It is bigger than a duck; and distinguished from
other divers by a remarkable sawed bill to retain its slippery
prey, which consists principally of eels.&nbsp; 62. The <span
class="smcap">Snew</span>, as well as the <span
class="smcap"><i>Widgeons</i></span>, and other species of wild
ducks, are very common. <a name="citation199"></a><a
href="#footnote199" class="citation">[199]</a>&nbsp; 63. The
<span class="smcap"><i>Puffin</i></span>, has a remarkable <a
name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 199</span>bill, which
differs from that of a duck in being formed not horizontally but
vertically, for the purpose of feeding in clefts of rocks, on
shellfish, &amp;c.&nbsp; 64. The <span
class="smcap">Shear-water</span>, somewhat billed like a
cormorant, but much smaller, is a strong and fierce bird, that
hovers about ships when the sailors cleanse their fish,
&amp;c.&nbsp; They will live some weeks without food.&nbsp; 65.
The <span class="smcap"><i>Gannet</i></span>, is a large, white,
strong billed bird: Sir Thomas Browne saw one of them in
Marshland, which fought, and would not be forced to take
wing.&nbsp; Another he saw taken alive, and for sometime kept and
fed with herrings.&nbsp; 66. 67. The <span
class="smcap">Shag</span> and <span
class="smcap">Cormorant</span>, are generally confounded by the
country people.&nbsp; The former builds upon trees, and the
latter only in the rocks.&nbsp; 68. The <span
class="smcap">Northern-Diver</span>.&nbsp; 69. The <span
class="smcap">Great Crested Grebe</span>, appear about April, and
breed on the broad waters.&nbsp; Their nest is formed of weed
&amp;c. and float on the water, so that their eggs are seldom dry
while they are set on.&nbsp; 70. The <span class="smcap">little
Grebe</span>, <i>small diver</i> or <i>Dabchick</i>, is found in
the rivers and broad waters here.&nbsp; 71. The <span
class="smcap">Skua Gull</span>, is sometimes found here in very
hard winters.&nbsp; 72. The <span class="smcap">Herring
Gull</span>, is found here, but more commonly about
Yarmouth.&nbsp; 73. The <span class="smcap">Black-headed
Gull</span>, is here very plentiful.&nbsp; The eggs are used by
the country people in puddings, and otherwise.&nbsp; The birds
are sometimes brought to the markets in great <a
name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 200</span>number, and
even sent to London.&nbsp; 74. The <span class="smcap">Greater
Fern</span>, or <i>Sea Swallow</i>, is a neat white and
fork-tailed bird, but much larger than a swallow.&nbsp; 75. The
<span class="smcap">May Chitt</span>, is a small dark-grey
bird.&nbsp; It comes in great plenty into Marshland in May, and
stays about a month, seldom beyond six weeks.&nbsp; It is fatter
than most birds of its size, and accounted excellent
eating.&nbsp; 76. The <span class="smcap">Churre</span>, another
small bird, is frequently taken among the preceding.&nbsp; 77.
The <span class="smcap">Whinne bird</span>, is marked with five
yellow spots, and is less than a wren.&nbsp; 78. The <span
class="smcap">Chipper</span>.&nbsp; This somewhat resembles the
former; comes here in the spring, and feeds on the first buddings
of birches and other early trees.&mdash;To all these may be
added, 79. The <span class="smcap">Nightingale</span>, which is
here a constant visitor.&nbsp; 80. 81. 82. The <span
class="smcap">Swallow</span>, <span class="smcap">Martin</span>,
and <span class="smcap">Swift</span>.&nbsp; Also a variety of
<span class="smcap">Finches</span>, and likewise of <span
class="smcap">Diving-Fowl</span>, <i>mustela fusca</i>, <i>and
mustela variegata</i>, so called from the resemblance they have
to the head of a weesel.&mdash;Stockdoves, or wild pigeons, are
here found in great numbers; and so are Pheasants, Snipes, and
Woodcocks. <a name="citation200"></a><a href="#footnote200"
class="citation">[200]</a>&nbsp; The Magpie likewise and the Owl
are found among the birds of this country.&mdash;Not to mention
the Blackbird, the Thrush, the Yellow-hammer, the Wagtail, the
Titmouse, the Sparrow, the Wren, the Redbreast, and others that
are common to most parts of this kingdom.</p>
<p>Many rare plants are said to be found in some parts of this
country; but as no good botanist is known to reside <a
name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 201</span>here, or to
have drawn up a catalogue of them, they cannot be now
enumerated.&nbsp; The neighbourhood of <i>East Winch</i> is
thought to be one very good spot for botanizing.</p>

<p>Before we conclude this chapter, and this first part the work,
it may not be improper, or unacceptable to the reader, to take
some notice of a few of the most remarkable places on this side,
that have been omitted in the preceding pages.&nbsp; We shall
begin with</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Sechey</span>, <a
name="citation201"></a><a href="#footnote201"
class="citation">[201]</a> commonly called <i>Sech</i>, a small
market town, which lies about three miles from Lynn, to the
south, on the Downham and London road.&nbsp; Anciently it
belonged to the Lords Bardolf, as apart of their manor of north
Runcton.&nbsp; In 33. Hen. III. the then Lord Bardolf had a
charter of free warren here, with a weekly <a
name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 202</span>market on
Mondays, and two fairs annually.&nbsp; Afterwards it passed, with
the rest of the said manor, to the Earl of Warwick, who in the
reign of James I. had a grant of a market here every fortnight,
on Tuesdays, for fat cattle.&nbsp; It seems rather doubtful, if
these markets were originally kept every other Tuesday
<i>throughout the year</i>: at least it is said not to have been
the case for many years past, but only for some of the latter
months of the year.&nbsp; They begin at the dawn of day, and are
generally over pretty early in the morning.&nbsp; They are also
said to be well attended by butchers and graziers from different
parts of the country, and sometimes from a considerable distance,
even as far as Norwich, or further, and also from
Lincolnshire.&mdash;The river is navigable, for lighters, a
considerable way up into the country beyond this place.&nbsp;
Sechey is in the parish of <i>North</i> Runcton; some miles from
which, in a southerly direction lies the church of <i>South</i>
Runcton, now in a dilapidated state.&nbsp; This ruin presents a
semicircular east end of what has been thought an <i>ancient
Saxon</i> church, and is believed to be the remains of one given
to St. Edmund, in the reign of Canute.&mdash;Of the
reasonableness and tenability of this belief, some doubts,
perhaps, may be justly entertained.&nbsp; The said ruin has
certainly the appearance of considerable antiquity, but that
appearance, together with its uncommon and semicircular form,
will not be quite sufficient to satisfy every one, that it is
altogether as old as the days of Canute, or that it has actually
stood the brunt and braved the blasts of near a thousand
winters.&mdash;A few miles further on, in the same direction,
is</p>
<p><a name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 203</span><span
class="smcap">Downham</span>, or <i>Market Downham</i>, as it is
sometimes called. <a name="citation203"></a><a
href="#footnote203" class="citation">[203]</a>&nbsp; It is
pleasantly situated on the side of a hill, and upon the Ouse,
over which it has a good bridge.&nbsp; It had heretofore two
weekly markets, Mondays and Saturdays, but that is no longer the
case; the latter only are now to be considered as its proper
market days, on which the town is said to be well supplied with
fish and wild fowl, from the adjacent fens.&nbsp; Downham was
formerly celebrated for its great butter market, which used to be
kept near the bridge, every <i>Monday</i>, and which it seems,
has before now supplied London with the immense quantity of
ninety thousand firkins in a year.&nbsp; From its being sent by
way of Cambridge, it obtained the name of Cambridge butter.&nbsp;
These markets have been discontinued, and the butter is now taken
for sale to Swaffham.&nbsp; It is said that the privilege of a
market was granted to Downham by Edward the confessor, and that
its principal manor, with the whole hundred, were given by king
Edgar to Ramsey Abbey, whose abbot, as we are further informed,
was authorized by King John to hold a fair here.&nbsp; By Henry
III. he was invested with the additional authority to try and
execute malefactors at his &ldquo;gallows of
Downham.&rdquo;&mdash;Some monastic buildings, and particularly a
<i>priory</i> of Benedictine monks, stood formerly near the
church.&mdash;There is in this town a small dissenting
congregation, the chapel belonging to which, was erected in the
early part of the last century.&nbsp; In 1801 the town and whole
parish of Downham contained 278 houses, and 1512 inhabitants.</p>
<p><a name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
204</span>Further on, in a low situation, is <span
class="smcap">Denver</span>, a large village, noted as the birth
place of <i>Dr. Robert Brady</i>, the English historian.&nbsp;
The church is a mean structure, built of <i>Car</i>, <i>or
rag-stone</i>, <i>camerated</i> with <i>wooden</i> pannells, and
covered with <i>reed</i>, or <i>thatch</i>.&nbsp; Near to this
place is <i>Denver Sluice</i>, termed the grand <i>erratum</i> in
our fen improvements.&mdash;Not far from Denver and Downham lies
the village of <i>Helgay</i>, said by some authors <a
name="citation204"></a><a href="#footnote204"
class="citation">[204]</a> to be regularly infested, every six or
seven years, by an incredible number of field mice, which, like
locusts, would infallibly devour all the corn of every kind, but
for the friendly, seasonable, and effectual interposition of a
prodigious flight of owls from Norway, which never fail to arrive
that year, and stay till they have totally destroyed those
mischievous vermin: after which they quietly depart, re-cross the
seas, and return to their native forests, attended by the
veneration and benediction of all the good people of Helgay, who
had derived from them, the most essential benefit, without the
least mixture of detriment; as they had, during their whole stay,
meddled with no one thing in the place, but the mice.&mdash;Such
is the substance and purport of this curious story, whose
questionable and improbable appearance might be supposed more
than sufficient to prevent its being ever passed upon the public
as a matter of fact.&nbsp; That, however, has not been the case:
it has been therefore introduced here for the purpose of
exhibiting it in its true light, as a lying tale, that those
credulous <a name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
205</span>people who have been imposed upon, and misled by
others, may be undeceived.</p>
<p>Beyond Helgay are the villages of <i>Southery</i>,
<i>Feltwell</i>, <i>Methwold</i>, <i>Northwold</i>,
<i>Stoke-ferry</i>, <i>Wereham</i>, <i>West Dereham</i>,
<i>&amp;c.</i> some of them of pretty large size and
population.&nbsp; <i>West Dereham Abbey</i> was formerly a place
of no small note, and founded as early as 1188.&nbsp; At the
dissolution it went into private hands, and about the close of
the 17th. century it was the seat of Sir Thomas Dereham, a
diplomatic character.&nbsp; More recently it has successively
been the seat of Sir Simeon Stuart, and Lord Montrath.&nbsp;
<i>Wereham</i> in former times was possessed by the
<i>Clares</i>, who then ranked high among the English barons; and
it was the head lordship of what was, and still is called the
<i>honor of Clare</i>, of which several neighbouring manors were
held.&nbsp; Those great lords had here a <i>prison</i>, and of
course a <i>gallows</i> also; which indicate the great sway they
once bore in these parts.&mdash;These places lie in and about a
remarkable drainage tract, called <i>the Feltwell new fen
district</i>, which, like the river Nene, has proved a very
unfortunate concern to many of those whose property had been
unhappily entrusted in the hands of its commissioners.&nbsp;
Suspicions of some disreputable doings are said to have been
entertained respecting both the above concerns, which will
probably deter many from affording any pecuniary aid to the
projected Eau-brink Cut, lest it should turn out, or be managed
as badly:&mdash;if indeed the present formidable opposition to it
should finally fail to effect its entire relinquishment: an event
which many <a name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
206</span>seem to consider as not at all
improbable.&mdash;Northerly from these parts is the village and
parish of <i>Fincham</i>.&nbsp; In that parish church is a square
font, supposed to have belonged to the old church, which is
mentioned in Domesday-book.&mdash;Further on, in the same
direction, and the most considerable place that way, is</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Swaffham</span>.&nbsp; This respectable
town stands on high ground, upon a dry gravelly soil, and in a
situation that seems greatly favourable to health and
longevity.&nbsp; Its streets are wide and airy, and the buildings
distributed over a considerable space of ground.&nbsp; The houses
are generally neat, and many of them large and handsome,
inhabited by wealthy and genteel families.&nbsp; The market-hill
is pleasant and spacious, on which was erected in 1783 an elegant
cross, by the Lord Orford of that time.&nbsp; The market is on
Saturday, and plentifully supplied with good provisions.&nbsp;
The great butter-market, formerly kept at Downham, is now kept
here.&nbsp; The town stands so high, that some of the wells are
said to be fifty-yards deep.&nbsp; A handsome assembly-room has
been erected on the west side of the market-hill, in which
subscription assemblies are held every month.&nbsp; But the chief
public structure of the town is the <i>Church</i>, a large and
fine edifice, built at different times, in the reigns of Henry
VI. Edward IV. and Henry VII.&nbsp; It is in the form of a
cathedral, and consists of a nave and two ailes, with two
transepts on the south side, one to the north, and a lofty well
proportioned tower, which is surmounted with enriched embrasures,
and purfled pinnacles.&nbsp; The nave is very lofty, having
twenty-six cleristory windows, <a name="page207"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 207</span>and its inner roof ornamented with
carved wood, figures of angels, bosses, &amp;c.&nbsp; The north
aile and steeple, are said to have been built by one <i>John
Chapman</i>, stated, but erroneously it seems, to have been a
<i>travelling tinker</i>; and who is also reported to have been
Church-warden in 1460.&mdash;In 1800 the houses of Swaffham
amounted to 452, and the population to 2220.&nbsp; Formerly there
was here a rector and a vicar; the latter presented by the
former; so that the rectory was a <i>Sinecure</i>, and probably a
very rich one.&nbsp; The patronage of the vicarage is in the
bishop of Norwich.&mdash;Near this town is an extensive heath,
which forms a convenient race-ground.&nbsp; The races here are
held about michaelmas.&nbsp; Coursing matches are also frequent
here, and the <i>greyhounds</i> are as regularly entered for the
purpose, and placed under the same restrictions as
<i>running-horses</i>. <a name="citation207a"></a><a
href="#footnote207a" class="citation">[207a]</a></p>
<p>Further on, between Swaffham and the sea-coast, there are not
many places that seem to demand very particular notice.&nbsp;
<i>Babingley</i> and <i>Sharnborne</i>, which both lie that way,
are traditionally reported to contain the sites of the two first
christian places of worship among the East-Anglians, and supposed
to have been erected in the seventh century.&nbsp; In the same
way lies <i>Snettisham</i>, a large village, said to have been
formerly a town, with a weekly market on Fridays.&nbsp; Here also
have been dug up several of those instruments, in the shape of
hatchet-heads, with handles to them, usually denominated celts,
<a name="citation207b"></a><a href="#footnote207b"
class="citation">[207b]</a> which, if taken to be British, as is
most generally <a name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
208</span>thought, or even Roman, as has been judged by others,
most denote that Snettisham is a place of no inconsiderable
antiquity.&nbsp; <i>Brancaster</i> has been already noticed, as
once a famous Roman station; and it may be here added, that it
has of late years attracted no small attention on account of its
<i>great malt house</i>, built with a view to the export trade,
and supposed to be the largest edifice of that kind in the
kingdom; being 312 feet in length, by 31 in breadth, and
furnished with all the necessary offices and conveniences for
conducting the malting process on a large scale: 420 quarters of
barley, are said to have been there wetted weekly, during the
malting season.</p>
<p>To the west of Brancaster and the said great malt-house, and
not far off, is the village of <i>Hunstanton</i>, or
<i>Hunston</i>, as it is most commonly called: near to which, on
a cliff, overlooking Lynn Roads and the entrance into Lynn Haven,
and elevated ninety feet above high-water mark, stands the
<i>Hunston Light-house</i>, which is upon a different
construction from other English light-houses, and supposed
superior to any of them.&nbsp; It is lighted by lamps and
reflectors, instead of coals, on a much improved and very
judicious plan, the merit of which is due to <span
class="smcap">Mr. Walker</span> <i>of Lynn</i>, by whom it was
invented, and under whose direction it was here executed in
1778.&mdash;This light is communicated by 18 concave reflectors,
each of eighteen inches diameter.&nbsp; They are fixed upon two
shelves, one placed over the other in such a manner that the
strongest light may be seen where it is most wanted.&nbsp; In the
N by E direction <a name="page209"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
209</span>a strong light is necessary for ships to avoid the
dangerous sands and shoals on the Lincolnshire coast; here
therefore are placed seven reflectors in the space of two points
of the compass, which will appear at some distance as one
light.&nbsp; In other directions a weaker light is
sufficient.&nbsp; A single reflector, with a lamp of ten single
threads of cotton placed in the focus of the curve, which is a
parabola, will appear, at 15 miles distance, larger than a star
of the first magnitude:&mdash;that is, if the glass be kept
clean, and the lamp trimmed; otherwise, instead of light, there
will no doubt be found obscurity, for which no blame can attach
to the projector. <a name="citation209"></a><a
href="#footnote209" class="citation">[209]</a></p>
<p><a name="page210"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 210</span>This
house remained for many years the only one of the kind in the
United Kingdom; but about the year 1787, several others, on the
same plan, were erected on the coast of Scotland, as appears by
the following extracts from one of the provincial papers of that
time.&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Northern
Light-houses</span>.&nbsp; An Act of Parliament was obtained a
few years ago, by some gentlemen in Edinburgh, impowering them to
erect four Light-houses on the Northern parts of Great
Britain.&nbsp; In consequence of which the Trustees made diligent
enquiry into the several modes of erecting lights for the use of
mariners, at sea.&nbsp; These enquiries were made not only in
this kingdom, but in foreign parts, that their intended erection
might be made on the best principles.&nbsp; In September, 1786,
the then Lord Provost of Edinburgh applied to Mr. Ezekiel Walker
of Lynn in Norfolk, for his opinion in the construction of
them.&nbsp; Mr. Walker&rsquo;s answer to his lordship&rsquo;s
enquiry, and the plan projected in it, gave such general
satisfaction to the Trustees, that they unanimously resolved on
constructing and lighting them on his principle; and in the
spring of 1787, the work was begun accordingly.&nbsp; The first
of these lights stands on <i>Kinnard&rsquo;s Head</i>, [in the
county of Aberdeen;] the second on <i>north Ranaldshaw</i>, <a
name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 211</span>the
northernmost of the Orkney Islands; the third on the <i>point of
Scalpa</i> in the isle of Herris; and the fourth on the <i>Mull
of Kyntire</i>, which may be seen in Ireland.&rdquo; <a
name="citation211"></a><a href="#footnote211"
class="citation">[211]</a></p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Cumberland Packet of Sept.</i>
10. 1788.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the same paper, of Dec. 9. 1789, appeared the following
passage&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>Light-houses</i>.&nbsp; The excellent
method of erecting light-houses prescribed by Mr. E. Walker is
now sufficiently proved.&nbsp; That it produces a <i>strong
light</i> is well known, but that this desirable object is
attained at a small expence of <i>oil</i>, can only come under
the inspection of a few; however one argument, even in favour of
this is now made public.&nbsp; The Commissioners for erecting
four light-houses on the northern parts of Great Britain obtained
another Act the last session of Parliament, authorizing them to
erect a <i>fifth</i>: &ldquo;For the light-house on the south
west point of the Mull of Kyntire is found to be of the greatest
importance to the navigation of ships passing to and from the
<i>north</i> channel; but not to ships passing to and from the
Firth of Clyde through the <i>south</i> channel.&nbsp; It is for
the security of ships navigating this <i>south</i> channel that
the commissioners purpose erecting another light-house on the
island of <span class="smcap">Arran</span>, or upon the little
island of <span class="smcap">Plada</span>, near the same; which
is to be done <i>without any increase of the duties</i>
authorised to be levied by the former act.&rdquo;&mdash;This act
also authorizes the commissioners to erect other light-houses on
the coast of Scotland, whenever the produce of the present duties
on the tonage of <a name="page212"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
212</span>ships will enable them so to do.&mdash;This at once
justifies the decided opinion of the commissioners in favour of
Mr. Walker&rsquo;s projection, and pronounces the most
unequivocal encomium on his abilities.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Being now about to close our remarks on the country about
Lynn, it may be here noted, in regard to Marshland and the fenny
parts in general, that so little care appears to have been taken
there to counteract, or guard against the natural insalubrity of
the country, and promote the health of the inhabitants, that not
a few of the older dwelling-houses, and particularly those of the
cottagers, and lower classes, have their floors actually
underground, or below the surface of the land on the
outside.&nbsp; This can be said to furnish but a very indifferent
sample or specimen of the boasted wisdom of our ancestors.&nbsp;
Those of the present generation, however, cannot with much good
grace blame them on this occasion, while they are themselves at
the expence and pains of keeping up and repairing those same
unhealthful dwellings.&nbsp; Our new houses indeed are generally,
if not always constructed upon a much better plan; and that may
be said to be one of the few things in which we appear to exceed
our forefathers.&nbsp; In other things we certainly fall short of
them, and act our parts much worse than they would have
done&mdash;even so much worse, that they would unquestionably
have blushed for, and despised us, and that very justly, had they
foreseen some of our recent proceedings.</p>

<p class="gutsumm">Of Lynn while Britain formed a part of the
Roman Empire.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Section</span> I.</h4>
<p class="gutsumm"><i>The present town</i>, <i>or borough of
Lynn</i>, <i>of no great antiquity&mdash;its site not the same
with that of the original town&mdash;the probable site of the
latter</i>, <i>and era of its origin</i>.</p>
<p>What is now called <i>Lynn</i>, <i>Lynn Regis</i>, or the
<i>Borough of King&rsquo;s Lynn</i>, is generally considered as a
place of no very high antiquity.&nbsp; It arose probably during
the Heptarchy, out of the ruins of the old town, though not built
on the same spot, and must soon have become a place of no small
consideration in the kingdom of the East Angles, as may very
reasonably be concluded, from the convenience of its situation
for trade and commerce.&nbsp; We hear not much of it, however
till after the conquest, when it presently appears as a place of
growing importance, under the direction and management <a
name="page214"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 214</span>of its new
French masters, the enterprising companions and agents of the
successful Norman adventurer, the Bonaparte of the eleventh
century.</p>
<p>But though no traces can be discovered of the existence of a
town on the <i>eastern</i> side of the river, prior to the time
of the Heptarchy, it is more than probable, that there was a town
on the opposite, or <i>western</i> side, long anterior to that
period.&nbsp; That town has not yet entirely disappeared.&nbsp;
It may still be recognized in the little village called <i>Old
Lynn</i>; a name which plainly indicates, that the original town
must have stood there.&nbsp; It is well known that the town on
the eastern side was formerly called <i>New Lynn</i>, or rather
<i>New </i><span class="smcap"><i>Len</i></span>, and that the
other was then distinguished from it by the name of <i>Old
Len</i>.&nbsp; No good reason can be assigned for this, but that
the latter was the original town, known by the name of <i>Len</i>
long before the other had any existence.&nbsp; The attempt made
by Spelman, Parkin, and others to elude this conclusion is weak
and frivolous.&nbsp; It does not appear that there ever has been
any period, since the eastern, or modern town existed, when the
inhabitants did not apply the name of <i>Old Len</i>, or <i>Old
Lynn</i> to the other.&nbsp; There can therefore be no manner of
doubt, but that it is to this same old Lynn we are to look for
the site of the ancient and original town.&nbsp; It is probable,
indeed, that that town might extend much nigher to the spot now
occupied by the present town, than what the village of Old Lynn
now does, as the bed of the river was formerly very narrow,
compared with what it is at present; and the waters are allowed
to have made <a name="page215"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
215</span>considerable encroachments on the western shore.&nbsp;
When, and by whom the original town was founded, as well as, what
may be the true etymology, or real meaning of its name, are
points that are involved in no small obscurity, and cannot,
therefore, be very easily and clearly settled, or
ascertained.&nbsp; It seems, however, highly probable, if not
certain, as shall be shewn by and by, that it took its name from
its marshy situation, and was founded by the Romans, at the time
when they undertook to drain the fen-country, and rescue
Marshland, by strong embankments, from the power and ravages of
the ocean.&nbsp; It may also pretty safely be concluded, that
this must have taken place within the first century of the
christian era, and probably in the reign of Nero, if not in that
of Claudius. <a name="citation215"></a><a href="#footnote215"
class="citation">[215]</a>&nbsp; The foundation of Lynn may
therefore be considered as coeval with the first introduction of
Christianity into this island; which was nearly if not quite 1750
years ago: and though this fixes the origin of Lynn at a pretty
remote period, and much beyond what has hitherto been supposed,
yet it seems to be supported by no small degree of
probability.</p>
<h4><a name="page216"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
216</span><span class="smcap">Section</span> II.</h4>
<p class="gutsumm"><i>A short digression relating to the first
Introduction of Christianity into Britain&mdash;Bardism</i>.</p>
<p>Having, at the close of the preceding section, suggested an
opinion that the origin of Lynn was coeval with the first
Introduction of Christianity into this country, it will not, it
is presumed, be any way improper, or unacceptable to the reader
to offer here a few observations toward ascertaining the time
when the last mentioned event took place, especially as all our
English writers and antiquaries have left the matter very much in
the dark.</p>
<p><i>Gildas</i>, a writer of the sixth century, and the most
ancient of all our British historians, states that &ldquo;the
Gospel began to be published here about the time of the memorable
revolt and overthrow of the Britons under Boadicea,&rdquo; which
happened in the year 60 or 61, and was followed by a long
interval of peace, which could not fail of proving favourable to
the introduction of the new religion and the general success of
its publishers.&nbsp; Speaking of the said revolt, together with
its disastrous termination and consequences, Gildas adds,
&ldquo;In the mean time, Christ, the true Sun, afforded his rays,
that is, the knowledge of his precepts, to this Island, benumbed
with extreme cold, having been at a great distance from the sun;
not the sun in the firmament, but the eternal sun in
heaven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This account, given by Gildas, is remarkably corroborated by
the <i>Triads of the Isle of Britain</i>, which are ancient
British documents of undoubted credit, though <a
name="page217"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 217</span>but little
known. <a name="citation217a"></a><a href="#footnote217a"
class="citation">[217a]</a>&nbsp; From them we learn that the
famous <i>Caradoc</i>, or <i>Caractacus</i>, having been
overthrown in the war, and afterwards basely betrayed and
delivered up to the Romans, by <i>Aregwedd Voeddig</i> (the
<i>Cartismandua</i> of Roman authors) was, together with his
father <i>Br&acirc;n</i>, (or <i>Brennus</i>) and whole family,
carried captive to Rome, about the year 52, where they were
detained seven years, or more.&nbsp; At that time Rome enjoyed
the preaching of the gospel, and Br&acirc;n with others of the
family became converts to the christian religion.&nbsp; After the
expiration of their captivity, they returned home, and were the
means of introducing the knowledge of Christ among their
countrymen: on which account, Br&acirc;n is called, one of the
three holy sovereigns, and his family, one of the three holy
lineages of Britain.&nbsp; The Triads also have preserved the
names of three of the primitive christians who accompanied
Br&acirc;n on his return to this country, and who were probably
the very first christian ministers that ever set foot on this
island: one was an Israelite of the name of <i>Ilid</i>; of the
other two, one was called <i>Cyndav</i>, and the other
<i>Arwystli H&ecirc;n</i>, or Arwystli the aged. <a
name="citation217b"></a><a href="#footnote217b"
class="citation">[217b]</a>&nbsp; This account is very curious,
and, in all probability, authentic. <a name="citation217c"></a><a
href="#footnote217c" class="citation">[217c]</a></p>
<p><a name="page218"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 218</span>When
Br&acirc;n returned to his native country, it has been understood
that some of his family stayed behind and settled at Rome.&nbsp;
Of them <i>Claudia</i>, mentioned, along with <i>Pudens</i> and
<i>Linus</i>, in the second Epistle to Timothy, is supposed to be
one, and the very same with <i>Claudia the wife Pudens</i>,
mentioned by the poet <i>Martial</i>, who lived in those times,
and who celebrates her, in his Epigrams, as a <i>Briton</i> of
extraordinary beauty, wit, and virtue.&nbsp; To this it has
indeed been objected, that Martial, living in the reign of
<i>Trajan</i>, cannot be supposed to speak of Paul&rsquo;s
Claudia, who flourished in the reigns of <i>Claudius</i> and
<i>Nero</i>.&nbsp; But it might be urged in reply, that though he
lived in Trajan&rsquo;s reign, he lived also, and resided at
Rome, in the reign of <i>Vespasian</i>, if not in that of
<i>Nero</i>; and the Epigrams in which he mentions <i>Claudia</i>
might be written in his younger years, when she was in the prime
and bloom of life.&nbsp; Some have made her to be the <i>daughter
of Caractacus</i>, which seems not at all unlikely.&nbsp;
<i>Pomponia Gr&aelig;cina</i>, the wife of Aulus Plautius,
Claudius&rsquo; Lieutenant, and the first Roman Governor here,
has also been, thought a Briton and a christian, and one of the
earliest British Christians.&nbsp; Tacitus speaks of her as an
illustrious lady, but accused for having embraced a
<i>strange</i> and <i>foreign superstition</i>; <a
name="citation218"></a><a href="#footnote218"
class="citation">[218]</a> and though he says she was acquitted,
as to any thing immoral, yet he represents her as leading ever
after a <i>gloomy and melancholy kind of life</i>: all which will
strictly coincide with the idea of her being a
<i>christian</i>.&nbsp; Tacitus could conceive or express himself
no otherwise of a person dissenting <a name="page219"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 219</span>from his own pagan tenets, or of a
religion disallowed by the Roman law, which was with him the
standard of truth, rectitude, and orthodoxy.&nbsp; The above
accusation and trial of Pomponia Gr&aelig;cina took place, it
seems, while Nero and Calphurnus Piso were Consuls, and after
Paul had come to Rome the first time, and therefore she may not
unreasonably be supposed one of his converts.</p>
<p>Other authorities render it highly probable, that some of
those captives had embraced Christianity during their residence
at Rome; but the <i>Triads</i>, above-mentioned, may be said to
settle the point, and reduce the matter to a certainty.&nbsp;
They were documents formed on purpose to preserve and perpetuate
the memory of remarkable and interesting events; of which sort
may justly be considered, the conversion of Br&acirc;n and
family, and their introducing Christianity into this
island.&nbsp; There is every reason to conclude, that the
religion of the first British Christians was venerably simple,
pure, and perfect, like what appears in the New Testament, and
very widely different from that of the men of the present
generation.&nbsp; But this subject we will now drop, and resume
the thread of the narrative. <a name="citation219"></a><a

<p class="gutsumm"><i>The ancient history of Lynn
continued&mdash;the town supposed to have been founded by a
colony of foreigners</i>, <i>introduced by the
Romans&mdash;etymology of its name&mdash;mistakes of Camden</i>,
<i>Spelman</i>, <i>&amp;c. pointed out</i>.</p>
<p>The great project formed by the Romans of embanking, draining,
and improving these fens and marshes, is said to have been
executed by a foreign colony, <a name="citation220"></a><a
href="#footnote220" class="citation">[220]</a> <a
name="page221"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 221</span>brought
over and settled here for that purpose, but, without doubt,
powerfully assisted by the natives.&nbsp; This colony is presumed
to have been of Batavian or Belgic origin; for where could the
Romans have found a people so fit for their purpose as among the
inhabitants of a country that so much resembles this, and who
must have been, while at home, habituated to the work in which
they were here to be employed?&nbsp; The vicinity of those
countries to this, and their then subjection to the Romans, may
be considered as further corroborating this opinion.&nbsp; From
the exposed situation of Marshland, and its lying next to the
inhabited part of the country, it may very reasonably be
supposed, that these colonists would begin their work there, and
even on its eastern side, about where Lynn now stands: and as
they would immediately want habitations, it is very natural to
conclude, that the town of Old Len, or Lynn, was built for, or by
them, and that they were the very people that gave it its
<i>name</i>.&nbsp; These conclusions appear remarkably
countenanced and supported by that very name itself; for LEN, in
the <i>Celtic</i> (or <i>Belgio-celtic</i>) dialect, or language,
is said to signify a <i>Fen</i>, <i>Morass</i>, or <i>Marsh</i>.
<a name="citation221"></a><a href="#footnote221"
class="citation">[221]</a>&nbsp; LEN, therefore, as they applied,
or used the word here, might mean a town by a morass, the town in
the marsh, or the chief town and mother town of Marshland and the
Fens.&nbsp; This seems to be, by far, the most tenable and
satisfactory explanation of the name of this ancient town, that
has ever yet been offered or suggested.</p>
<p><a name="page222"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
222</span><i>Camden</i> derives the name of Lynn from the British
word <i>Llyn</i>, which signifies <i>a lake</i>; but
circumstances do not at all support that idea.&nbsp; There was
anciently at Lynn no very large collection of waters: its very
river was inconsiderable, consisting only of the water of the
<i>Little Ouse</i>, and the <i>Wissey</i>, together with that of
the <i>Nar</i>, or Setch river, formerly called <i>Len</i>, and
sometimes <i>Sundringham Ea</i>. <a name="citation222a"></a><a
href="#footnote222a" class="citation">[222a]</a>&nbsp; The very
harbour also, for many ages, was remarkably narrow.&nbsp; As to
the waters below, in the roads, &ldquo;It is very unlikely that
the Britons should call them <i>Llyn</i>, (<i>i.e. Lake</i>,) a
name which they never appear to have given to similar collections
of water: but if we were to admit, that they actually gave that
name to these waters, still it would seem exceedingly improbable,
that this place should derive its name from thence, any more than
<i>Rising</i>, or other towns that are situated near to the like
estuaries, or arms of the sea.&rdquo;&nbsp;
<i>Spelman&rsquo;s</i> conjectures on this point are weaker and
more untenable still.&nbsp; He would have the name to be derived
from the <i>Saxon L&aelig;n</i>, or <i>Lean</i>, signifying, as
he says, a <i>farm</i>, or <i>tenure in fee</i>; but which sense,
according to <i>Hicks</i>, is unusual: nor is it likely, as
<i>Gough</i> has observed, that this tenure should be more
particularized here than elsewhere. <a name="citation222b"></a><a
href="#footnote222b" class="citation">[222b]</a>&nbsp; Equally
futile is what he further advances, &ldquo;that <i>Len</i> is
Saxon for church-land; whence <i>Ter Llen</i>, in Welsh, is
church-land:&rdquo; which is most strangely confounding those two
languages, as if the one had sprung from the other.&nbsp; Nor is
it strictly true, that <i>Ter llen</i> in welsh <a
name="page223"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 223</span>means
<i>church-land</i>, or even that there is such a welsh word in
being.&nbsp; <i>Tir llan</i> might, indeed, have such a meaning,
but it does not seem to be ever used in that sense.&nbsp;
<i>Llen</i> or <i>Ll&euml;en</i>, in that language, means
<i>literature</i>, and not church; and as an adjective, it means
<i>literary</i>, <i>scholastic</i>, or <i>clerical</i>; whence
<i>gwyr llen</i>, or <i>ll&euml;en</i>, signifies the
<i>clergy</i>, as <i>gwyr lleyg</i>, or <i>lleygion</i> does
<i>the laity</i>.&nbsp; But all this can make nothing for
Spelman&rsquo;s point, and it must, of course, fall to the
ground.&mdash;That Lynn ever went by the name <i>Maidenburg</i>,
from saint Margaret the virgin, seems to be another of the idle
whimsies of dreaming antiquarians.&nbsp; Of all such dreamers
none perhaps ever exceeded <i>Parkin</i>, the continuator of
Blomefield the Norfolk historian: whenever he is at a loss for
the etymology of the name of any town or village, he generally
refers to the <i>British</i>, and pretends to explain it
accordingly.&nbsp; Never is he more ready or flippant than when
speaking of the signification of British words; of which, at the
same time, he knew nothing at all.</p>

<p class="gutsumm"><i>Lynn the mother-town of the
Fens&mdash;further account of its supposed founders and original
inhabitants&mdash;remarkable works executed by them&mdash;great
improvers of the country&mdash;the account continued to the
extinction of the Roman power</i>.</p>
<p>Lynn, as has been already suggested, was, in all probability,
the very first town built by the above mentioned colonists, and
so the mother town of that extensive <a name="page224"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 224</span>country, which they were the means
of recovering, improving, and securing from the annoyance of the
salt and stagnant waters.&nbsp; Being their original dwelling
place, it may naturally be supposed, that it would continue
afterward to be their principal habitation or settlement,
although in the progress of their work, and as they advanced
further on, other dwellings and villages would of course be
constructed and inhabited.&nbsp; Considering these people as
originally from Belgium or Batavia, than which nothing is more
likely, it may from thence be inferred, that the intercourse
between Lynn and the Low Countries must have been of very early
origin.&nbsp; Some connection or traffick between these colonists
and their mother country may fairly be supposed to have commenced
from their very first settlement here: so that the trade and
intercourse between Lynn and the Netherlands may be concluded to
be now of above seventeen hundred years standing.</p>
<p>Those industrious colonists seem not to have, in the least,
disappointed the hopes or expectations of their employers.&nbsp;
They appear to have carried on and executed the work with great
diligence, skill, and success.&nbsp; It is probable, as before
hinted, that they began on the eastern side of Marshland, (that
being nighest the habitable or inhabited part of the country, and
where also their first town or settlement would naturally be
erected) and from thence extended their labours to Wisbeach, and
so on to the Marshes of Holland, in Lincolnshire, and other parts
of the country which they were to recover and improve.&nbsp; The
Banks which they constructed <a name="page225"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 225</span>in their progress were large, high,
and firm, and such as effectually secured the country from the
incursion and depredation of the sea.&nbsp; They are still known,
in most places, and even on the eastern side of the Ouse and in
the vicinity of Lynn, by the name of the <i>Roman
Banks</i>.&nbsp; Nor does it appear that they were less judicious
or successful in their attempts to drain and improve the parts
which they had so well and effectually rescued from the
Ocean&rsquo;s destructive power; for by accounts handed down from
ancient writers, it would seem that the country within their
banks, at least a great part of it, was soon brought to an
admirable state of cultivation, improvement, and fertility, like
another paradise, and remained so for many ages. <a
name="citation225"></a><a href="#footnote225"
class="citation">[225]</a></p>
<p>Even <i>roads</i>, of considerable length and width, appear to
have been made by the same people in this new recovered and
marshy country, constructed of gravel of no small depth and
breadth, and formed in a most masterly manner: of which that
leading from <i>Denver</i> to <i>Peterborough</i>, or rather,
perhaps, to <i>Castor</i>, or <i>Caister</i> in Northamptonshire,
is a most remarkable, and very striking instance.&nbsp; This
road, according to <i>Dugdale</i> (as has been already observed
in the <i>Introduction</i>) was composed of gravel, three feet
deep, and sixty wide: at present, it is said to be covered with a
moorish soil, from three to five feet thick.&nbsp; The
constructing of such a road, and carrying it for so many miles,
through a country almost totally destitute of gravel, stone, or
any other materials proper for road-making, <a
name="page226"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 226</span>which must
therefore have been procured from a vast distance, and with
immense labour and difficulty, must have been a very
extraordinary and stupendous achievement.&nbsp; In comparison
with which, how puny are the efforts and performances of our
modern adventurers, or commissioners of roads, in this flat
country!&nbsp; A proof of this we have in the great Turnpike Road
that leads from <i>St. German&rsquo;s</i> to <i>Wisbeach</i>,
where attempts have been making now for some years to cover it
with gravel, but hitherto with no very great effect.&nbsp; At any
rate, it must appear, that those ancient Colonists, introduced by
the Romans, for the purpose of recovering and improving this
great fen-country, were eminently qualified for the work in which
they were employed, and ought to be still held in grateful
remembrance by the good people of England, especially those of
Marshland and the Fens, and esteemed among their very best
benefactors.&mdash;The merit of those works and improvements,
however, should not be <i>all</i> ascribed to them: the
<i>Romans</i>, who introduced, employed, and maintained them, and
who projected the undertaking, should be allowed some share of
it.&nbsp; Nor are the <i>natives</i>, or Britons, who
laboriously, powerfully, and effectually assisted in carrying on
those works and improvements, to be entirely overlooked or
forgotten on this occasion.&nbsp; The latter are said to have
borne so large a share in those laborious undertakings, as to
occasion very serious complaints and remonstrances from some of
their countrymen to, and against the Romans, as having cruelly
exhausted their strength, by the excessive hardships and fatigues
they had been obliged to undergo in that service.&nbsp; Nor is
this at all incredible; for <a name="page227"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 227</span>the Romans are known to have been
often very unfeeling, severe, and cruel task-masters to the
nations they had subdued.&nbsp; If the country was improved it
was always at the expense of the sweat and treasure, and not
unfrequently of the groans and lives of its inhabitants.</p>
<p>The improvements begun in and about the fens, as well as in
other parts of the country, were probably in some measure
attended to during the whole continuance of the Roman power in
this island.&nbsp; On the decline of that power, and especially
after the departure of the Roman legions, there is reason to
believe that they were neglected and relinquished.&nbsp; The
grievous and calamitous scenes which then ensued, would leave no
room or opportunity for such pursuits as could be attended to
only in the happy seasons of internal tranquillity.</p>
<p>Although we have considered the original inhabitants of Lynn,
Marshland, and the Fens, as consisting for the most part of
colonists from the continent, we are probably not warranted to
conclude, that they were in fact, a Roman Colony, or invested
with the rights and immunities of Roman citizens.&nbsp; It may,
however, be very reasonably supposed, that they were favoured
with some particular privileges, to which, indeed, they appear to
have been very justly entitled.&nbsp; But whatever they might be,
it is not likely that they enjoyed them for any great length of
time after the dissolution of the Roman government here: the
country then soon fell a prey to foreign and merciless invaders,
and everything was involved in universal confusion and ruin.</p>

<p class="gutsumm"><i>Character of the Anglo-Saxons</i>, <i>with
general observations on the invasion and conquest of this country
by them</i>, <i>and their barbarous treatment of the
inhabitants</i>.</p>
<p>The Saxons, who soon succeeded the Romans in the possession of
this country, were never very remarkable for forming and
encouraging projects of improvement, or for cultivating the arts
of peace.&nbsp; They were, indeed a very different sort of people
from the others, and possessed all their bad qualities without
any of their good ones.&nbsp; They had long been distinguished as
a fierce and lawless race, a nation of pirates, and freebooters,
like the modern <i>Algierines</i>, whose chief delight consisted
in predatory expeditions, and all manner of acts of violence and
brutality, which passed with them for national virtue,
patriotism, and military glory.</p>
<p>Long before they had effected any settlement in Britain, they
used to make frequent descents upon the <a
name="page229"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 229</span>coast,
particularly that of Norfolk, Suffolk, and Essex.&nbsp; To guard
against which, the Romans not only kept a fleet cruising in these
seas, but also built a chain of forts in the most convenient
places, which they had well garrisoned.&nbsp; These forts were
nine in number, and extended from Brancaster to Yarmouth, and
thence down a considerable way along the coast; and (as was
before observed) the troops here stationed, a good part of which
consisted of cavalry, were under the command of an officer
called, <i>The Count of the Saxon shore</i>.&nbsp; This
provision, or precaution, however, proved, too often, but a very
imperfect security against the sudden inroads of those ancient
and daring marauders. <a name="citation229"></a><a
href="#footnote229" class="citation">[229]</a></p>
<p><a name="page230"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 230</span>Of
all the nations of the north, the Saxons appear to have been the
most barbarous and most sanguinary.&nbsp; The <i>Francs</i>, who
conquered Gaul, were a civilised people <a
name="page231"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 231</span>compared
with them.&nbsp; Of the use of letters they were totally
ignorant.&nbsp; All knowledge that had not some affinity with
piracy, or tendency to improve their system of rapine and
devastation, was by them held in the utmost contempt and
abhorrence.&nbsp; <i>Gildas</i>, who was born but a few years
after their arrival in this country, describes them as a most
fierce and detestable people, &ldquo;a nation odious both to God
and man.&rdquo; <a name="citation231"></a><a href="#footnote231"
class="citation">[231]</a>&nbsp; They were invited here to assist
the inhabitants in opposing the incursions of the <i>Picts</i>
and <i>Scots</i>; but they soon turned their arms against their
infatuated employers, and converted the war into a system of
extermination.</p>
<p>Their countrymen on the continent long retained the original
character of their nation.&nbsp; During many ages they continued
preeminent for their bloodthirsty disposition and savage
manners.&nbsp; <i>Charlemagne</i> subdued them, after a thirty
years war, and forced them to become converts to <i>his</i>
Christianity, and submit to baptism; but their ferocity he did
not subdue, nor had their conversion any effect towards
humanizing them.&nbsp; They were, however, <i>called
Christians</i>: which was like calling evil, good, or Satan, an
angel of light.&nbsp; These Saxon Christians, in the twelfth
century, quarrelled with the <i>Venedi</i>, a neighbouring
nation, because they objected against embracing <i>their</i>
Christianity, and refused to renounce their own paganism, which
they seemed to prefer, for its cheapness.&nbsp; The former they
found to be an institution attended with an expence which they
could but ill support.&nbsp; Bishoprics were to be erected, with
large revenues, <a name="page232"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
232</span>Monasteries to be endowed, and an annual tribute, under
the name of tithes, to be paid by the whole country.&nbsp;
Against this the Venedi remonstrated, to Bernard Duke of Saxony,
the christian champion.&nbsp; They protested that they were very
poor, and unable to bear any heavy burden, such as providing for
the maintenance of priests, and especially for the dignity and
parade of mitred prelates; that they were fully determined to
suffer any extremity, even to abandon their country and state,
rather than submit to so tyrannical an oppression.&nbsp; This
firm opposition of theirs to the will of the christian potentate,
or rather the Saxon tyrant, involved them in a long and bloody
war, the final issue of which was, their utter extirpation, by
Henry Duke of Saxony, surnamed the Lion, the great champion of
the church on that occasion.&nbsp; The cruelty with which he
disgraced his victory, was horrible.&nbsp; Few revolutions in
history were attended with such circumstances of barbarity, or
proved so destructive to the ancient inhabitants. <a
name="citation232"></a><a href="#footnote232"
class="citation">[232]</a>&nbsp; Even Charlemagne, after he had
subdued the Saxons, by a long and bloody war, did not attempt to
destroy their whole race, but only transplanted a part, and the
remainder he endeavoured to reconcile to his empire by the
establishment of his Christianity.&nbsp; But the <a
name="page233"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 233</span>Saxons, by
far more cruel than the Francs, were of all conquerors the most
destructive, extending the utmost rigour of the sword against
those who dared to contend with them for liberty or empire.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In the same ferocious manner, (says the
historian) their ancestors some centuries before had behaved in
Britain, where they either massacred or expelled the greatest
part of the natives, who had invited them over to their
assistance.&nbsp; None of the other nations that overran the
Roman Empire behaved with such cruelty to the conquered
inhabitants, or were inflamed with such rancour and animosity, as
to attempt to convert those provinces into deserts.&nbsp; The
Goths, the Burgandians, the Lombards, instead of massacring the
Romans in cold blood, and endeavouring to extirpate their whole
race, enacted very just laws in favour of those people, in
consequence of which the Romans and those fierce barbarous, their
conquerors, were considered in the same light as fellow
citizens.&nbsp; <i>Theodorick</i> king of Italy, a Gothic prince,
upon sending an army into Gaul, makes use of these words to his
general, which deserve to be inscribed on pillars of brass,
&ldquo;Let other kings delight in the plunder and devastation of
the towns they have subdued; we are desirous to conquer in such a
manner, that our new subjects shall lament their having fallen
too late under our government.&rdquo; <a
name="citation233"></a><a href="#footnote233"
class="citation">[233]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>How much happier had it been for the Britons to have been
invaded by Theodorick than by the Saxons!</p>
<p>From the above account of the character of the ancient <a
name="page234"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 234</span>Saxons, one
may be enabled to form a pretty just, but shocking idea of the
miseries in which they involved the wretched inhabitants of this
country, and those of Lynn and its vicinity among the rest.&nbsp;
The exterminating war which they here waged, and the horrid
devastation which attended their successful progress, have been
recorded by Gildas, who himself lived at that eventful period,
and must have been an eye-witness to no small portion of the
direful events which he describes.&nbsp; Nothing can exceed the
tragical description he gives of the diabolical and destructive
operations of those brutal invaders.&nbsp; He represents the
whole country, and especially the western parts, near to which he
chiefly resided, as entirely laid waste with fire and sword, and
the inhabitants massacred wherever they could be found.&nbsp; Of
the wretched remnant, some fled to foreign countries, others
retired to the mountains, or hid themselves in deserts and
fastnesses, where, however, they could not long
remain:&mdash;drawn forth by the pressing calls of hunger and
famine, multitudes were forced to surrender to the merciless foe,
begging that their lives might be spared, on the abject and
miserable condition of submitting to perpetual slavery.&nbsp;
Even of these not a few appear to have been instantly consigned
to destruction. <a name="citation234a"></a><a
href="#footnote234a" class="citation">[234a]</a>&nbsp; Others,
however, were spared; and from them, in all probability, sprung
the <i>Servi</i>, or slaves, with which the country abounded for
many ages after. <a name="citation234b"></a><a
href="#footnote234b" class="citation">[234b]</a>&nbsp; Some of
the wretched <a name="page235"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
235</span>inhabitants were so fortunate as to make their escape
to their countrymen, either in <i>Wales</i>, or in <i>Devon</i>
and <i>Cornwall</i>, or else in <i>Cumberland</i> and the
northern parts, where they made a noble stand, and long
maintained their liberty and independence.</p>

<p class="gutsumm"><i>Of the</i> <span
class="smcap">Angles</span>, <i>from whom England</i>, <i>and the

the denomination of East Anglia</i>, <i>and forms one of the
kingdoms of the Heptarchy&mdash;revival of Lynn in the mean
time&mdash;with remarks on the adjacent country</i>.</p>
<p>Those Saxon conquerors of our island consisted of different
clans, or tribes, one of which went by the name of <i>Angles</i>;
and though they are not generally supposed to have composed the
principal or most numerous part of the invaders, yet it so
happened, that the whole of the conquered country and also the
language of its new inhabitants took their names from them.&nbsp;
They took possession of the ancient country, or province of the
<a name="page236"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 236</span>Iceni,
and there founded the kingdom of East Anglia, or of East Angles,
comprehending the present counties of Norfolk, Suffolk,
Cambridge, and Huntingdon, which made some figure among its
sister kingdoms in the time of the Heptarchy.&nbsp; The kingdom
of Mercia and that of Northumberland also, it seems, were
inhabited by the same people.</p>
<p>Of Lynn, during that dark and disastrous period, no account
has been preserved.&nbsp; It was probably destroyed by those
merciless invaders, during their long and bloody contest with the
ill fated natives, along with many other towns, all over the
country, which certainly met the same fate. <a
name="citation236"></a><a href="#footnote236"
class="citation">[236]</a>&nbsp; At what time it revived, or rose
again into existence, is no where recorded.&nbsp; But from the
convenience and advantage of its situation it may be supposed to
have done so pretty soon after the government of the East-Angles
had assumed a settled form, and acquired a competent or tolerable
share of stability.&nbsp; That it existed under the East-Anglian
kings, seems a very natural and credible supposition; but whether
it stood then on the western side only, or on both sides of the
river, cannot now be ascertained.&nbsp; Under the Saxon princes
that succeeded the dissolution of the Heptarchy, it is well known
to have extended to the eastern shore of the river; and it is
then, most probably, that we are to date the origin of the
present town or borough of <a name="page237"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 237</span>Lynn.&nbsp; In the time of Edward,
called the confessor, we find it a place of trade and
considerable note; a plain proof that it must have been in being,
and growing into consequence a good while before that
period.&nbsp; It belonged then to <i>Ailmar</i>, bishop of
Elmham, and his brother <i>Stigand</i>, archbishop of Canterbury,
when blind superstition and ecclesiastical servility may
naturally be supposed to have been among the principal or most
distinguished characteristics of its inhabitants.&nbsp; It
continued afterward under episcopal domination and ghostly
discipline till the memorable reign of Henry VIII. who thought
proper to take into his own hands that power or supremacy which
was before vested in the bishops.&nbsp; In consequence of which,
it has ever since been called <span
class="smcap">King&rsquo;s</span> <i>Lynn</i>, instead of <span
class="smcap">Bishop&rsquo;s</span> <i>Lynn</i>, which was its
former appellation: an appellation, by the bye, which will serve
further to corroborate the idea, that it was formerly the
deleterious abode of priest-ridden credulity and ecclesiastical
thraldom.&nbsp; Indeed it may be said to have been long
distinguished for illiberality, intolerance, and a persecuting
spirit: and it must appear somewhat remarkable, that the very
first person taken up and burnt, in England, under that
diabolical law, <i>De h&aelig;retico comburendo</i>, was a Lynn
man, as was also the last, or one of the very last that underwent
persecution for nonconformity under the infamous <i>conventicle
Act</i>: The former was one of the preachers belonging to St.
Margaret&rsquo;s Church, in the reign of <i>Henry IV.</i> and the
latter a licenced dissenting minister in that of <i>William</i>
III.&nbsp; Of each of them a more particular account shall be
given in its proper place.</p>
<p><a name="page238"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 238</span>Not
only Lynn, but most, if not all, of the adjacent towns and
villages appear to have been in being long before the
conquest.&nbsp; They are noticed in the celebrated old record,
called <i>Domesday</i>, as places then in existence, and
seemingly of long standing and remote origin.&nbsp; They had, in
all probability, been erected and inhabited many ages before that
period, though it seems not likely that many of their present
names, or those given them in the Domesday book, are to be traced
to a British origin, as Parkin and others pretend. <a
name="citation238a"></a><a href="#footnote238a"
class="citation">[238a]</a></p>
<p>That Lynn had become a place of considerable trade in the
Saxon times, or before the Norman invasion, is evident from
unquestionable existing documents.&nbsp; It had then a
toll-booth, and enjoyed certain duties and customs, payable on
the arrival of any goods or merchandise, of which the bishop was
in full possession of a moiety.&nbsp; This episcopal privilege is
supposed to have been as early as the conversion of the East
Angles, and establishment of Christianity among them.&nbsp; The
town continued daily to flourish and acquire increasing
importance; and at an early period after the conquest, one of the
writers of that time calls it, &ldquo;a noble city,&rdquo; on
account of its trading and commercial magnificence. <a
name="citation238b"></a><a href="#footnote238b"
class="citation">[238b]</a>&nbsp; This was at a period when Hull
did not exist, and when Liverpool, if it did exist, was but a
very obscure and insignificant place.</p>

<p class="gutsumm"><i>Of the Saltworks formerly at and about
Lynn&mdash;paucity of appropriate
materials&mdash;apology</i>.</p>
<p>The vicinity of Lynn in the Saxon times, and long after,
appears to have been remarkable for its numerous Saltworks. <a
name="citation239a"></a><a href="#footnote239a"
class="citation">[239a]</a>&nbsp; At Gaywood alone, in the
Confessor&rsquo;s time, there were no less than <i>thirty</i>
Salt pans, or pits. <a name="citation239b"></a><a
href="#footnote239b" class="citation">[239b]</a>&nbsp; The Salt
springs of Droitwich, Nantwich, Northwich, &amp;c. were then, it
seems, not so much attended to as to afford a supply to the
distant parts of the kingdom.&nbsp; The people of these parts
were therefore obliged to manufacture their own salt.&nbsp; To
what extent the work was carried on, or what quantity was
generally, or annually produced, cannot now be ascertained.&nbsp;
Nor are we informed of the particular mode, or process adopted
and pursued in carrying on this ancient manufactory.&nbsp; It
was, probably, pretty simple and not very unlike that used in
latter times in the salt-works of South-town, by Yarmouth, and at
other places.&nbsp; By the great number of Salt-works then at
Lynn, or in its neighbourhood, it seems probable, that a
considerable part of the adjacent country, and the interior
districts, were supplied from thence with that necessary article:
which might easily, even at that early period, be conveyed
thither, by means of the inland navigation, which always gave to
Lynn the vast advantage of a free and easy intercourse with all
those places, however distant, that are situated near the banks,
or in the neighbourhood of its numerous rivers.&nbsp; The Salt
manufactured here was made, it seems, from the sea water which
the <a name="page240"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
240</span>tides brought up to the town, and which must have been,
of course, much less salt, and less fit for the purpose than the
water found below in the roads, or at sea: it appears therefore
rather odd, that those salt-works should be placed so far up the
country, or so distant from the sea: and yet so it was; every
village and hamlet, almost, had then its Salt-work, or the moiety
of one. <a name="citation240"></a><a href="#footnote240"
class="citation">[240]</a>&nbsp; Here it may be proper to
observe, that, at the periods of which we have been speaking,
salt was not an article of revenue, and must therefore have been
a pretty cheap commodity compared to what it is now, when the
duty laid upon it by government is said to be above ten times its
prime, or original cost.</p>
<p>In attempting to give an account of the state of things at
Lynn during the period which we are now contemplating, almost all
our light must be borrowed from the general history of the
kingdom in the mean while, as the paucity of materials, relating
particularly to this town, leaves us, for the most part, no other
clew for our guidance.&nbsp; The reader must not therefore be
displeased with the method here generally pursued, in exhibiting
the state or history of Lynn under its East-Anglian and
Anglo-Saxon sovereigns.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of Lynn, after it had been rebuilt and
repeopled by its Anglian masters, appear to have been blind
heathens, and gross idolaters; for when the Angles, or
Anglo-Saxons seized upon this country, and founded the
East-Anglian kingdom, they were a nation of pagans, worshippers
of <i>Thor</i> and <i>Woden</i>, and the rest of the miserable
objects of northern, or Scandinavian adoration; and so continued
till the seventh century.&nbsp; At that period, one of their
princes, named <i>Sigebert</i>, having lived sometime in exile
among the Francs, was there converted to Christianity.&nbsp; At
his restoration to his kingdom, he brought over with him one
<i>Felix</i>, a Burgundian <a name="page242"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 242</span>priest, who was employed in
recommending to the people the religion of their sovereign, in
which he appears not to have been unsuccessful.&nbsp; He was
consequently appointed the first bishop of the East Angles, and
had his see fixed at <i>Soham</i>, <a name="citation242"></a><a
href="#footnote242" class="citation">[242]</a> in Cambridgeshire,
and afterwards at <i>Domnoc</i>, or <i>Dunwich</i>, in
Suffolk.&nbsp; He is said to have taken no small pains in
promoting the conversion of the inhabitants; and the parts about
Lynn seem to have engaged a considerable share of his
attention.&nbsp; In these very parts he is reported to have
commenced his labours, which issued in the conversion of the
whole country.&nbsp; Tradition gives to <i>Babingley</i>, by
Lynn, the honour of being the place where he first landed, and
where was erected the very first christian chapel, or place of
worship among the East Angles.&nbsp; The second edifice of the
same description is said to have been erected at
<i>Sharnborn</i>, in the same neighbourhood.&nbsp; At what time
the first place of that sort was built at Lynn, cannot now be
determined; but it seems very probable that it must have been as
early, at least, as the middle part of the seventh century.&nbsp;
It cannot, however be said, that the Christianity then introduced
was of any great value.&nbsp; The national character was not
much, if at all, mended by it; and the people still remained
grossly ignorant, profligate, and savage.&nbsp; What they wanted
in rational piety and real Christianity, they made up in stupid
credulity, blind zeal, and miserable superstition; and it had
been well if their descendants had always carefully avoided the
imitation of their wretched and pernicious example.</p>
<p><a name="page243"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 243</span>It is
somewhat remarkable that Christianity, as it was called, was not
received among the East-Angles till it had made considerable
progress in most of the other kingdoms of the Heptarchy.&nbsp; In
Kent it had been received about the year 526, or soon after, by
the ministry of <i>Austin</i> the monk: and even before that
time, several years, some of the Kentish people had been brought
to think favourably of that religion, by the means of
<i>Luidhart</i>, a French bishop, who had accompanied the
princess <i>Birtha</i>, daughter of Cherebert, king of Paris,
upon her marriage with Ethelbert the Kentish king.&nbsp; The
conversion of the East Saxons took place about the beginning of
the seventh Century under the ministry of <i>Mellitus</i>, their
first bishop: and soon after, that of the Northumbrians, where
<i>Paulinus</i> appeared as a very active and successful
labourer.</p>
<p>Felix did not begin his labours among the East Angles till
about the year 630, when that religion had made some progress in
all the other kingdoms, perhaps, except that of Mercia, which
seems to have been the last of the seven to adhere to the
profession of paganism.&nbsp; The Mercians, however, were
afterwards converted, and their country, at one time, formed into
an archiepiscopal province, whose seat or metropolis was
<i>Litchfield</i>.&nbsp; Thus the different branches of the
hierarchy were all, by degrees, nominally christianized.&nbsp; Of
the nature, character, and value of that Christianity, a just and
proper idea may be formed from the following representations.</p>
<h4><a name="page244"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

<p class="gutsumm"><i>Effects of the conversion of the
East-Angles</i>, <i>and the other sister-kingdoms&mdash;character
of their Christianity</i>.</p>
<p>No sooner were the good people of this country converted from
paganism than <i>monkery</i> began to be in great request among
them.&nbsp; Many monasteries were accordingly founded in all
parts of England, which were quickly crowded with
inhabitants.&nbsp; A fondness for the monastic life is said to
have been here very much increased by an impious doctrine which
began to be broached and believed toward the close of the seventh
century, &ldquo;That as soon as any person put on the habit of a
monk, all the sins of his former life were forgiven.&rdquo;&nbsp;
This is said to have engaged many princes and great men (who are
sometimes as great sinners as their inferiors) to put on the
monkish habit, and end their days in monasteries; which, whatever
it might be to themselves, was, probably, no mighty loss to their
subjects and vassals, or to the world.</p>
<p>Another remarkable feature in the character of the English
christians of the seventh and following centuries, was an
extravagant veneration for <i>relics</i>; in which the Romish
priests drove then a very gainful trade, as few good christians
thought themselves safe from the perils or disasters of life, and
the machinations of the devil, unless they carried about them the
relics of some paint: nor could any church be dedicated without a
decent or certain quantity of the same sacred and precious ware.

<p><a name="page245"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
245</span>Stories of <i>dreams</i>, <i>visions</i>, and
<i>miracles</i> were also propagated without a blush, by the
clergy, and believed without a doubt, by the laity.&nbsp;
Extraordinary <i>watchings</i>, <i>fastings</i>, and other arts
of tormenting the body in order to save the soul, became frequent
and fashionable; and it began to be believed in the seventh
century, that a journey to Rome was a most meritorious
undertaking, and even, of all others, the most direct road to
heaven.&mdash;Such was the christianity of the good people of
Lynn and the rest of their countrymen in those days.</p>
<p>In the eighth century the humour of making pilgrimages to
Rome, and of retiring into monasteries, still increasing,
<i>Coinred</i> king of Mercia, as <i>Henry</i> informs us, laid
down his sceptre, and took up the pilgrim&rsquo;s staff, in 709,
and travelled to Rome, accompanied by <i>Offa</i>, a young prince
of the royal family of the East-Saxons, <a
name="page246"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 246</span>where they
both became monks.&nbsp; Not long after, <i>Ina</i>, the warlike
and victorious king of the West Saxons imitated their example,
and ended his days in a cloister at Rome, where he founded a
house for the entertainment of English pilgrims, and the
education of English youth.</p>
<p>Great numbers of <i>nuns</i> also, and other English women,
were among those devout pilgrims who then travelled to Rome: but
we have the testimony of <i>Winfred</i>, alias <i>Boniface</i>,
archbishop of Mentz, who lived at that period, that they were
generally debauched before they returned, and even that many of
them became common prostitutes in the cities of France and Italy:
he therefore exhorts and charges his friend <i>Cuthbert</i>, then
archbishop of Canterbury, to put a speedy stop to these
scandalous female pilgrimages.</p>
<p>The religious prayers and songs, which constituted the church
service, were then all in <i>Latin</i>, and so not understood by
the common people, who were therefore directed by the 27th. canon
of the first council of Cloveshoos, or Cliff, in Kent, <a
name="citation246"></a><a href="#footnote246"
class="citation">[246]</a> held in 747, to affix any meaning they
pleased to the words in their own minds, and to pray in their
hearts for any or every thing they wanted, no matter how foreign
to the real sense of the public prayers.&nbsp; A curious salvo,
says <i>Henry</i>, for the absurd practice of praying in an
unknown tongue.&nbsp; The same canon contains also the following
short form of <i>prayer</i>, <i>for the dead</i>; &ldquo;Lord,
according to the greatness of thy mercy, grant rest to his soul,
and for thy infinite <a name="page247"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 247</span>pity, vouchsafe to him the joys of
eternal light with thy saints.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some of the nobility, or great men of that time, not very
fond, it seems, of going themselves through all the fastings and
prayers enjoined them by their confessors, would fain be allowed
to have the service performed by proxy: and it appears that they
actually hired and employed poor people to fast and pray in their
stead.&nbsp; It was, certainly, a very notable as well as
convenient device, and became, it seems, pretty fashionable,
though it is said not to have the good fortune of obtaining the
approbation of the said council of Cloveshoos. <a
name="citation247a"></a><a href="#footnote247a"
class="citation">[247a]</a></p>
<p>A late historian, <a name="citation247b"></a><a
href="#footnote247b" class="citation">[247b]</a> alluding to this
period, observes, &ldquo;that long fasting was then ordered
frequently; but as the wealthy might abstain by proxy, a seven
years fast might be performed in three days, if the principal
could prevail with 840 persons each to take his share.&nbsp; This
concise plan of atonement for crimes, (he adds) was condemned
solemnly at the council of Cloveshoos; but the decree was
disregarded.&rdquo;&nbsp; The practice therefore seems to have
gone on unchecked, notwithstanding the decree of that
council.&nbsp; It was not to be expected that so convenient a
custom could be very easily abolished.&nbsp; It may be worth
while to inquire, whether it had in it, after all, any greater
absurdity, than there is in the present <a
name="page248"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 248</span>practice of
the <i>infants</i> at the font, making a confession of their
faith <i>by proxy</i>.</p>
<p>Towards the latter part of the above period, a law was
enacted, enjoining every priest to learn some handycraft, or
manual occupation: which might be very useful; at least, it could
do no harm.&nbsp; Another law enjoined, that they should all be
capable of repeating the <i>Creed</i>, and the <i>Lord&rsquo;s
prayer</i>: which also might be very right and proper; but it
indicates that learning was then at a very low ebb among the
English clergy.&nbsp; We learn, however, that in the reign of
<i>Ethelred</i>, styled <i>the unready</i>, a mission was sent
from hence to Norway, at the request of the king of that country,
to convert the Norwegians and Swedes to the christian religion,
and that the archbishop of York, and other divines, actually went
over on that occasion, and met with great success; though some of
them afterwards are said to have suffered martyrdom; which seems
rather odd, if the king, as above suggested, was their
patron.&nbsp; Whatever their learning might be, their zeal must
have been highly commendable and exemplary.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Section</span> III.</h4>
<p class="gutsumm"><i>Christianity of the ancient inhabitants of
Lynn</i>, <i>and of this country</i>, <i>further
characterized&mdash;whether very materially improved during the
reign of Alfred&mdash;remarks on that reign&mdash;papal
instructions to the first missionaries</i>.</p>
<p>Ignorance and superstition, instead of diminishing, appear to
have increased in England, during the<i> eighth</i>
century.&nbsp; Pilgrimages to Rome became far more frequent, <a
name="page249"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 249</span>and were
attended with worse effects than formerly; the rage of retiring
to monasteries became more violent in persons of all ranks, to
the ruin of every useful art; the clergy became more knavish and
rapacious, and the laity more abject and stupid, than at any
former period: of which the trade of relics, then at its height,
and which can never be carried on, but between knaves and fools,
is a sufficient evidence.</p>
<p>During the memorable reign of the celebrated Alfred, the state
of religion has been supposed to have improved; but how far we
are warranted to admit, or carry that idea, does not seem very
clear.&nbsp; Alfred was, doubtless, a most excellent prince, as
may fairly and justly be inferred from that notable clause in his
Will, &ldquo;that the English had an undoubted right to be free
as their own thoughts,&rdquo; and particularly from his so
greatly magnifying, and acting upon that never to be forgotten
precept of Christ, &ldquo;to do unto others as we would have
others do unto us;&rdquo; not to mention the many other notable
and commendable deeds ascribed to him: <a
name="citation249"></a><a href="#footnote249"
class="citation">[249]</a> but that he was instrumental in very
materially reforming, or improving the religion of his country,
appears rather doubtful, if not improbable.&nbsp; His altering
the Ten Commandments, leaving out the <i>second</i>, and adding
another, to humour the worshippers of images, make very
considerably against the notion of his having much advanced the
work of religious reformation.&nbsp; The commandment which he
added, was expressed in these words, &ldquo;Make not thou gods of
gold, or of silver,&rdquo; <a name="page250"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 250</span>a precept, as it has been observed,
which few of his subjects could afford to transgress. <a
name="citation250"></a><a href="#footnote250"
class="citation">[250]</a></p>
<p>From Alfred&rsquo;s days to the conquest, the religion of
England experienced no amendment; nor ever after till the Era of
the reformation, or the 16th. century, except what took place
under the influence of Wickliff, and the Lollards; but they were
soon crushed under <a name="page251"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
251</span>the heavy and strong hand of priestly and royal
persecution: the very first victim, as was before observed, was a
Lynn man.</p>
<p>From the above representation of the original christianity of
the English nation, and of the Lynn people among the rest, one
cannot be very much biassed in its favour.&nbsp; But we shall
cease to wonder at its being no better, when we consider whence
it proceeded, and under what sort of rules or maxims it was
introduced.&nbsp; It was first brought hither and promulgated by
<i>Austin</i>, a monk of the convent of St. Andrew&rsquo;s at
Rome, accompanied by forty other Romish monks, all sent by the
then Pope, whose name was <i>Gregory</i>, commonly called Gregory
the first, and <i>Saint</i> Gregory, who was advanced to the
papal chair in 590.&nbsp; Austin and his companions arrived here
in 596.&nbsp; Among the instruction which pope Gregory gave
Austin for the regulation of his conduct and ministry, the
following are not the least remarkable.&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;He was not to destroy the heathen temples
of the English, but only to remove the images of their gods, to
wash the wails with holy water, to erect altars, and deposit
relics in them, and so convert them into christian churches; not
only to save the expence of building new ones, but that the
people might more easily be prevailed upon to frequent those
places of worship, to which they had been accustomed.&nbsp; He
directs him further, to accommodate the ceremonies of the
christian worship as much as possible to those of the heathen,
that the people might not be much startled at the change; and in
particular he advises him to allow the christian converts, on
certain festivals, to kill and eat a great number <a
name="page252"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 252</span>of oxen, to
the glory of God, as they had done formerly to the honour of the
devil.&rdquo; <a name="citation252"></a><a href="#footnote252"
class="citation">[252]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>These admonitions, (says Dr. Henry) which were but too well
observed, introduced the grossest corruption into the christian
worship, and shew how much the apostles of the sixth and seventh
centuries had departed from the simplicity and sincerity of those
of the first.</p>

<p class="gutsumm">Miscellaneous observations, on the social
distinctions, and the general state of the community among the
Anglo-Saxons.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Section</span> I.</h4>
<p class="gutsumm"><i>State of society at Lynn</i>, <i>and in
this country</i>, <i>before the Conquest</i>.</p>
<p>Of the state of Society in this country, as to the different
ranks among the inhabitants, the following is thought to be a
pretty fair and true representation.&mdash;The next rank below
that of the royal family was held by the <i>Thanes</i>, which
were, it seems, of different degrees, and we are told that the
highest order among them went by the name of <i>king&rsquo;s
thanes</i>. <a name="citation253"></a><a href="#footnote253"
class="citation">[253]</a>&nbsp; These also are said to have been
of two different sorts, <i>Eoldermen</i>, and <i>Eorles</i>; the
former supposed to be supreme in the administration of justice;
the latter comprehended military as well as civil authority, but
was not hereditary till the close of <a name="page254"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 254</span>the Saxon dynasty.&nbsp; The
<i>Ceorles</i> (Churles, or Carles) were next below the
thanes.&nbsp; They were free, descended from yeomen, and were
chiefly engaged in husbandry.&nbsp; To them the gate of nobility
was open, and they might become thanes by five different methods.
<a name="citation254a"></a><a href="#footnote254a"
class="citation">[254a]</a>&nbsp; Another order, or description
of men, in those times, was called <i>Huscarles</i>; (i.e.
house-carles:) they were retainers, or domestic dependents of the
thanes, and reputed freemen.&nbsp; All the rest of the community,
it seems, were slaves, of different descriptions.&nbsp; Of them
however, it would sometimes happen, though but very rarely, that
some obtained manumission, and they formed a particular class,
denominated <i>Freed-men</i>; but we are told that they were few,
and little regarded.&nbsp; They could obtain, it seems, no rank
in the state; and applying, for the most part, to mechanical
employments, seem hardly to have been distinguished from the race
which they had quitted.&mdash;Slaves were never suffered to carry
arms, and the very gift of a weapon conferred freedom.&nbsp; Of
the other orders no man went abroad without his spear; and laws
were enacted to guard against damages occasioned by the careless
bearer.&nbsp; In battle the ceorles who formed the infantry,
beside a broad sword, and sometimes a club, bore only a round
shield with an offensive pointed weapon in the centre.&nbsp; The
cavalry being composed of thanes, huscarles, and the richer
ceorles, who could afford to keep horses, was better provided
with defensive armour. <a name="citation254b"></a><a
href="#footnote254b" class="citation">[254b]</a></p>
<p>The enslaved part of the inhabitants, and which is said to
have constituted by far the most numerous class <a
name="page255"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 255</span>of the
community, went, like the privileged orders, by different
names.&nbsp; Of them the chief and most remarkably were the
<i>Villani</i> and the <i>Servi</i>.&nbsp; In regard to the
former, we are told that Villenage was of two kinds: 1st <i>Pure
Villenage</i>, to which some were subject from their birth, from
whom uncertain and indeterminate service was due to the
lord.&nbsp; The successors of these are our <i>copy-holders</i>;
who, though time has dealt favourably with them in other
respects, still retain one mark of their original vassalage, or
servitude; for as of old the former were not reckoned as members
of the commonwealth, but merely as part and parcel of the
owner&rsquo;s substance, no way entitled to the privileges of
freemen, so do their successors still continue without any right
to vote at elections by virtue of their copy-holds.&nbsp; 2nd
<i>Villenage by Tenure</i>, which bound the tenant to perform
certain services agreed upon between him and his lord; such as
ploughing his ground, reaping his corn, &amp;c.</p>
<p>The lowest, as well as most numerous class of slaves among the
Anglo-Saxons were the <i>Servi</i>, who, (as well as all the rest
of the unfreemen,) were probably the descendants of the
aboriginal inhabitants, who had escaped the general massacre, or
whose lives had been spared at the reduction and conquest of the
country.&nbsp; These were protected by neither law nor religion,
for a very long period; and they consequently suffered the most
unfeeling and cruel treatment.&nbsp; Christianity is said to have
ameliorated their condition.&nbsp; It certainly ought <a
name="page256"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 256</span>to have
done so; but from such a christianity no material amelioration
could well have been expected.&nbsp; Even our own boasted
protestantism, how feeble has generally been its influence in
such cases!&nbsp; The long and bloody contest between the rival
and barbarous houses of York and Lancaster did more, it seems,
for the relief and emancipation of those poor English slaves than
any thing else; for the contending parties, in order to recruit
and reinforce their armies, found it convenient and necessary to
liberate great numbers of them: at length they were all
manumitted, and Britain now contains no people of that
description.&nbsp; It would be well if the same could be said of
every other, part of the British dominions.&nbsp; These Servi are
often mentioned by Bloomfield and Parkin, and appear to have been
very numerous in the parts about Lynn before the conquest, and
even long after that period.</p>
<p>Beside the Villani and Servi, we meet with other descriptions
of bondmen, whose condition seem to have been less abject; at
least, less so than the latter.&nbsp; Of those one sort was
called <i>Bordarii</i>, <i>Bordars</i>, or <i>Borderers</i>: they
were such as held a cottage, or some small parcel of land, on
condition of supplying the lord with poultry, eggs, and other
small provisions for his board and entertainment.&nbsp; Such
small estates were formerly called <i>Bord-lands</i>, now
<i>demesnes</i>.&mdash;<i>Coliberti</i> was the name of another
description of bondmen among the Anglo-Saxons; and they were, it
seems, a middle sort of tenants, between servile and free; they
had their patrons, to whom they paid rent, and were manumised as
servants <a name="page257"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
257</span>used to be, but were not absolutely free.&nbsp; They
were such of the Servi as were enfranchised, or liberated in a
certain degree, but still paid some duties to the superior
lord.&nbsp; They appear to have been held in scarcely any higher
estimation than the class to which they had originally
belonged.&mdash;The <i>Burgaris</i>, <i>Burgenses</i>, or
<i>Burgesses</i>, was another order of bondmen among the
Anglo-Saxons.&nbsp; They were tradesmen in great towns, and had
their patrons, under whose protection they traded, and to whom
they paid an acknowledgement; but some of them were in a more
servile condition, and altogether under the power of the king, or
other lords. <a name="citation257a"></a><a href="#footnote257a"
class="citation">[257a]</a>&nbsp; Some of the above descriptions
of Anglo-Saxon bondmen, or British slaves, and particularly the
Villani, the Servi, and the Bordarii, were very numerous in the
parts about Lynn, in the times of which we are now speaking, and
long after. <a name="citation257b"></a><a href="#footnote257b"
class="citation">[257b]</a>&nbsp; England did then so abound in
slaves, and was so much <i>a land of slaves</i>, as to be able to
carry on a trade in that commodity with other nations, and
especially the <i>Irish</i>, whom English merchants, for a long
time, abundantly supplied with that favourite article, out of
their home stock, or native produce, with as little shame or
remorse as they have in modern times supplied the West Indies and
North America with the poor defenceless natives of ill-fated
Africa. <a name="citation257c"></a><a href="#footnote257c"
class="citation">[257c]</a>&nbsp; And yet the <a
name="page258"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 258</span>English was
then, as well as now, a christian nation, priding herself in the
fond idea of the purity and pre-eminence of her goodness, faith,
and piety.&nbsp; Alas, for poor christianity!&nbsp; How often
hath her venerable name been profaned and postituted on the
vilest occasions, and for the basest of purposes!</p>

<p class="gutsumm"><i>Of the </i><span
class="smcap"><i>Wittenagemote</i></span><i> and other
courts</i>, <i>maxims of jurisprudence</i>, <i>institution of
tythings</i>, <i>nuptial and funeral rites</i>,
<i>sacerdotal</i>, <i>domestic</i>, <i>and other customs</i>,
<i>among the Anglo-Saxons</i>.</p>
<p>The <i>Wittenagemote</i>, or assembly of wise men, was the
highest court among the Anglo-Saxons, and from which our
parliament seems to have originated.&nbsp; Bishops, judges, and
thanes composed it, and it does not appear that the lower orders,
or bulk of the people were there any how represented.&nbsp; The
business of this assembly was prepared and opened by the
king.&mdash;Another high court, but inferior to the former, was
the <i>Shiregemote</i>, in which much business was transacted in
the way of a modern assize.&nbsp; The Eolderman, or the Eorle was
the president, and the domesmen, or judges, with certain
<i>lawmen</i>, as they were called, formed the bench.&nbsp; <a
name="page259"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 259</span>It was held
only twice in the year.&mdash;The <i>Hundred Court</i> came next,
over which the Hundredary presided.&nbsp; Sales of estates,
registering of Wills, manumission of slaves, &amp;c. were here
transacted.&nbsp; It was also called <i>Wapontake</i>, from the
custom of always attending well armed.&nbsp; It was the
repository of deeds and records, was held monthly, and had the
jurisdiction of ten tythings.</p>
<p>Compensation to the injured party or his family, rather than
the annoyance of the criminal, being the principle of the
Anglo-Saxon jurisprudence, capital punishments were
unfrequent.&nbsp; The chastity of maidens was protected by very
severe laws; the ravisher of a nun was fined as an assassin, and
the violator of a child incurred the penalty of a severe
mutilation.&nbsp; Murder, as well as manslaughter, might be
atoned for, at a stated price: every wound had its exact value;
robbery was venial, and when committed on a bordering country,
(although in peace) was almost deemed laudable. <a
name="citation259"></a><a href="#footnote259"
class="citation">[259]</a></p>
<p><a name="page260"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 260</span>It
was in the institution of <i>Tythings</i>, or neighbourships,
that the wisdom of the Anglo-Saxons appeared most conspicuous and
admirable.&nbsp; Every ten families were connected together, as
fellows in arms and in civil society.&nbsp; Each answered for the
others&rsquo; good behaviour to the magistrate, and each joined
in paying the penalty which any one member might casually
incur.&nbsp; A man who was not inrolled in these tythings was
avoided by all, as a vagabond and person of bad character; nor
could he hope to be admitted to a tything unless his probity was
generally acknowledged.&nbsp; To Alfred this excellent
institution is said to owe its perfection; and its effects on
society must have been very great and salutary. <a
name="citation260"></a><a href="#footnote260"
class="citation">[260]</a></p>
<p>Of the customs of the ancient inhabitants of Lynn, and of the
Anglo-Saxons in general, relating to <i>matrimony</i>, the
following appear to have been some of the most remarkable and
striking.&mdash;Every unmarried woman was supposed to have a
guardian, or owner: the virgin belonged to her father, brother,
uncle, or nearest male relation; the widow claimed the same
protection from her husband&rsquo;s male relatives; the lover was
obliged to buy his mistress, of her guardian, by a gift, the
amount of which was settled by a law, that set a higher price on
the maid, by one half, than on the relict.&nbsp; If unadvisedly
the wooer wedded the lady without the guardian&rsquo;s consent,
her property and goods were still the property of that guardian,
and an injury offered <a name="page261"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 261</span>to her was to be atoned for to him,
and not to the spouse.&nbsp; At the wedding, the guardian
delivered up his ward to the husband, a friend of whom had
previously avowed himself the guarantee of a proper provision for
the bride in case of his death.&nbsp; At the feast which
followed, the usual and large presents of gold, silver, arms,
cloths, household stuff, &amp;c. made by the invited friends and
relations, formed the portion of the bride, who had beside, from
custom immemorial, a right to ask of her mate, on the next
sun-rising after her nuptials, a gift, to serve her as
pin-money.&nbsp; As to what related to <i>divorces</i>, among
these people, we meet with no particular account.&nbsp; In the
<i>education</i> of their children, they only sought to render
them dauntless, and apt for the two most important occupations of
their future lives, war and the chase.&nbsp; It was a usual trial
of a child&rsquo;s courage to place him on the sloping roof of a
building, and if, without screaming or apparent terror, he held
fast, it was deemed a favourable omen, and he was pronounced a
<i>brave boy</i>.</p>
<p>The <i>burial</i> ceremony is said to have been much more
joyous among them than that of marriage; which seems to imply
something very unnatural, as well as barbarous.&nbsp; The house
in which the body lay till its burial, was a perpetual scene of
feasting, singing, dancing, and every species of riot.&nbsp;
This, of course, was very expensive to the family of the
deceased; and it was in some places carried so far, that the
corpse was forcibly kept unburied by the visiting friends, till
they were certain that they had consumed, in games and frantic
festivity, all the <a name="page262"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
262</span>wealth the deceased had left behind him.&mdash;Nothing
can well exceed the barbarism and brutishness of such a custom:
and yet it seems to have long continued in some parts of this
island after the introduction of christianity, and even of
protestantism.&nbsp; Nay, some remains of it are known to have
existed in some places within the memory of some of the present
inhabitants.&nbsp; It is surprising how tenacious mankind often
are of their ancient customs, be they ever so vile, unseemly, or
heathenish.&nbsp; Heathenish, certainly, or of pagan origin, must
this most odious practice have been: but it is not the only
English custom that comes under that description.&nbsp; The
<i>Waites</i>, that usually go about before christmas, may be
considered as of the self-same origin, and belonged, in all
likelihood, to a certain pagan, riotous, and lawless feast,
celebrated at that time of the year: the precursor and prototype
of our principal christian festival.&nbsp; The ushering in of May
with the <i>blowing of horns</i>, a custom now almost, if not
<i>altogether peculiar to Lynn</i>, seems evidently to be of the
same class.&nbsp; It is still most tenaciously kept up in this
town, by the boys and children, though nobody pretends to know
either its meaning or its origin.&nbsp; But as May-Day is known
to have been one of the highest and most notable days of the year
among our heathen ancestors, the said custom may very safely be
concluded to have originated with them; especially as that day
does not appear to have ever been very much thought of by the
papists.</p>
<p>A notable custom among the Anglo-Saxon christians of the
eighth century, and from which Lynn cannot be <a
name="page263"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 263</span>supposed
exempted, was that of the <i>Clergy</i> usually celebrating Mass,
or administering the Sacrament <i>without Shoes and
Stockings</i>, and with chalices made of horn: which seems to
shew, that they had not then arrived at that sacerdotal pride and
pomp, at least in regard to their dress, which became so
prevalent among those of their order in latter times, when they
thought proper to assume a consequence so far above the other
orders of the community.</p>
<p>In private life the Anglo-Saxons are said to have been devout
to the extreme of credulity, and hospitable to drunken
extravagance.&nbsp; Their manners were rough, but social; their
tables were plainly, but plentifully served.&nbsp; Large joints
of roasted meat seem to have had the preference; salted victuals
also were much in use.&nbsp; At table, the rank of the guests was
strictly observed; and, by the laws of Canute, a person sitting
above his proper station was to be pelted out of his place with
bones, at the discretion of the company, without the privilege of
taking offence.&nbsp; The lady, (or, as the Saxons named her,
<i>leaf-dien</i>, the bread giver) sat, as now, at the upper end
of the table, and distributed the provisions to her guests.&nbsp;
The liquors used at genteel tables were wine, ale, and spiced
ale, pigment (a composition of wine, spice, and honey,) morat,
(honey diluted with mulberry juice) and mead. <a
name="citation263"></a><a href="#footnote263"
class="citation">[263]</a>&nbsp; Such, as may reasonably be
concluded, was the state of things with regard to these matters,
in the best of the families of Lynn at those times.</p>

<p class="gutsumm"><i>State of learning</i>, <i>and of the
medical profession</i>, <i>among the Anglo-Saxons</i>.</p>
<p>Learning during the time now alluded to was at a very low ebb
in this Country.&nbsp; &ldquo;Among the various discouragements,
(says <i>Andrews</i>) which literature was obliged to encounter
in this ill-fated period may be reckoned the extreme scarcity of
materials for writing.&rdquo;&nbsp; A strong proof of which (he
adds) &ldquo;is that many of the MSS. of the 10th and 11th
centuries are written on parchment, from which older works
(perhaps the Decades of Livy) have been erased.&rdquo;&nbsp; It
was for want of parchment to draw the deeds upon, (as he
supposes,) that estates, were then frequently conveyed from one
family to another by the ceremony of a turf and a stone,
delivered before witnesses, without any written agreement.&nbsp;
However that was, England even in those dark times, exhibited
some rays of intellectual light, and produced some literary
characters that would have done honour to more enlightened
ages.&nbsp; <i>Bede</i>, in particular, styled <i>the
Venerable</i>, who flourished in the 8th century, and has been
called, <i>the wise Saxon</i>, is believed to have comprised, in
eight folio volumes, the whole body of knowledge that his age
afforded.&nbsp; To him may be added <i>Egbert</i>, arch-bishop of
York, and his pupil <i>Alcuin</i>, both distinguished in their
day for extraordinary literary attainments.&nbsp; <i>Alfred</i>
and his learned associates appeared in the 9th century, and were
the ornaments of that dark age; but the light which they
exhibited was not lasting, and they left no successors that were
any way worthy of them.&nbsp; In the 10th (and most part of the
11th) century, scarce any man of literature appeared <a
name="page265"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 265</span>among the
English.&nbsp; <i>Elfric</i> is said to have been by far the most
remarkable and eminent.&nbsp; He was styled <i>the
grammarian</i>, from his having written a Latin grammar.&nbsp;
Two volumes of homilies, in MS. translated by him from the Latin
into the Saxon language, are said to be still extant.&nbsp; Very
few beside have in any degree contributed to illuminate the gloom
of that dismal period.&nbsp; <i>Gerbert</i>, however, who, from a
low origin, was advanced to the papal chair in 999, under the
name of <i>Silvester</i> II. deserves to be respectfully noticed,
as it is to his experience, gained by travel, and a long
residence among foreign nations, that our arithmetic is said to
owe the use of the Saracen numerals.&mdash;But as none of these
persons appear to have sprung from Lynn, or its vicinity, no
further notice can properly be taken of them in this work; and
what has been already said of them and other extraneous matters,
was chiefly intended for the purpose of pointing out the probable
state of things at Lynn in the meantime, for want of more
suitable and appropriate materials.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Physic</span> and <span
class="smcap">Surgery</span>, during those early ages, were in a
most wretched state in this country, and, of course, among the
inhabitants of Lynn.&nbsp; Old women were then the chief
professors of the medical art; and as they mingled charms and
spells with their prescriptions, the patient&rsquo;s fancy
sometimes effected, or, at least, assisted in effecting the
cure.&nbsp; As Christianity gained ground, the clergy, having
much time on their hands, applied themselves to the study of
medicine, but made so little progress, that for a long time,
<i>Holy Water</i> seems to <a name="page266"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 266</span>have been the prescription to which
they chiefly trusted.&nbsp; If holy water were still in use, as a
popular, fashionable, or favourite medical prescription, instead
of the innumerable patent medicines, and other vile quackeries
that now disgrace this ill-fated country, it had been better, no
doubt, for the health and constitutions of myriads of our unwary
and credulous fellow-subjects.&nbsp; There seems, however, but
little prospect of an end to this great and growing evil, while
quackery continues to be so convenient and gainful to the state,
or to contribute so largely, as it now does, to the revenue of
the kingdom.&nbsp; But it is not the only public evil, the
prospect of whose extinction appears very distant and
hopeless.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of Lynn and the rest of their countrymen, in
the Anglo-Saxon ages, could give more satisfactory reasons, it
seems, for the names of their months, than we can for those of
ours.&nbsp; December, which with them stood first, was called
<i>Midwinter-monath</i>, the midwinter month.&nbsp; January, was
denominated <i>Aefter-yula</i>, that is, after Christmas, or
rather, after the feast called Yula, a pagan, riotous, lawless
festival, observed <a name="page267"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
267</span>at that time of the year, and to which our Christmas
succeeded, with no small resemblance.&nbsp; February, they called
<i>Sol-monath</i>, the sun month, from the returning of the sun
at that season.&nbsp; March, they named <i>Rhede</i>, or
<i>Reth-monath</i>, the rough, or rugged month.&nbsp;
April&rsquo;s name was <i>Easter-monath</i>, from a favourite
Saxon goddess, whose festival was kept at that time, and may be
said to be still kept by us, under the idea of the christian
passover, which we seem to have dedicated to that same pagan
goddess, by our continuing to preserve her precious memory, and
celebrating the feast still in her name.&nbsp; May was called
<i>Trimilchi</i>, from the cows being then milked three times in
the day.&nbsp; June&rsquo;s name was <i>Seremonath</i>, the dry
month, July was called <i>M&oelig;d-monath</i>, the mead month,
from the meads being then in their bloom and beauty, or the
people being there employed in hay making.&nbsp; August had the
name of <i>Weod-monath</i>, the weed month, from the luxuriance,
or abundance of weeds at that time.&nbsp; September was named
<i>H&aelig;rfest-monath</i>, or the harvest month.&nbsp; October
bore the name of <i>Winter-fyllith</i>, or winterfall, from
winter approaching with the full moon of that month.&nbsp;
November, their last month, they called <i>Blot-monath</i>, blood
month, from the blood of the cattle then slain and stored for
winter provision.</p>
<p>The Anglo-Saxons are said to have made use of coins as early
as the reign of Ethelbright, or Ethelbert, who governed Kent from
561 to 616; as the fines ordered in his laws are all estimated by
shillings, which was even then a denomination of money.&nbsp; The
money-pound of <a name="page268"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
268</span>the Anglo-Saxons, is thought to have been the same with
the Tower-pound long in use at the mint, and to have weighed less
than the Troy-pound by &frac34; of a Troy-ounce.&nbsp; Its value
was about 2<i>l.</i> 16<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i> of modern money. <a
name="citation268a"></a><a href="#footnote268a"
class="citation">[268a]</a>&nbsp; The <i>Mark</i>, like the Pound
an imaginary coin, weighed eight ounces, or two thirds of the
Pound.&nbsp; The merchant reckoned 12 ounces to the mark.&nbsp;
Its value was 1<i>l.</i> 17<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i>&nbsp; The
<i>Mancus</i>, a real coin, was valued at the 8th. of a mark, or
4<i>s.</i> and 8<i>d.</i>&nbsp; The Shilling, a real coin, was
worth about eleven pence farthing of our money.&nbsp; The
Anglo-Saxon penny, (pening, or sceata,) was a silver coin, and
weighed near three-pence of our money.&nbsp; This little piece
would do more in those times for its owner, than some shillings
would do now.&nbsp; Halflings and Feorthlings, were the half, and
the fourth, or quarter of the Anglo-Saxon penny, and were of
silver.&nbsp; To these may be added a small brass coin called
Styca.&nbsp; Beside these coins, it was usual with the
Anglo-Saxons to complete the sum destined for any particular
purpose, by adding what they called <i>live money</i>, such as
oxen, sheep, horses, or <i>slaves</i>; <a
name="citation268b"></a><a href="#footnote268b"

<p><a name="page269"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 269</span>The
value or price of cattle, land, and other commodities, in the
times of which we are now speaking, amounted to but a very small
portion of what they now fetch.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;By the laws of Athelstan, (says Dr. Mavor)
a sheep was valued at a shilling, or fifteen-pence of our money:
an ox was computed at six times the value of a sheep, and a cow
at four.&nbsp; A horse was valued at thirty shillings of our
money, and a mare at twenty-four.&nbsp; Between the years 900 and
1000, a hide of land was purchased for about one hundred and
eighteen shillings, which was little more than a shilling per
acre. <a name="citation269"></a><a href="#footnote269"

adds) when we combine the alteration in the weight of the pound,
and the modern value of the precious metals from their greater
plenty, we may conceive every sum of money mentioned by
historians, during the Anglo-Saxon, and even the Norman times, as
if it were multiplied more than a hundred-fold above a sum of the
same denomination at present.&rdquo;</p>

horses <i>the chief exports of this country in those
days&mdash;corn not then exported</i>, <i>though it had been
formerly&mdash;imports&mdash;commerce&mdash;miscellaneous hints
and observations</i>.</p>
<p>Considering how very fruitful in slaves England appears to
have been under the Anglo-Saxons, and how commonly they bought
and sold their slaves, (and even their own kindred,) and that
they were actually a principal article of their exports to other
countries, <a name="citation270"></a><a href="#footnote270"
class="citation">[270]</a> it is more than probable that Lynn and
other Norfolk ports were then deeply concerned in that
traffic.&mdash;Slaves are known to have then abounded in the
parts about this town; and no other commodity, or produce of the
country, was more marketable, or saleable, both at home and
abroad; we may therefore be sure that the merchants and <a
name="page271"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 271</span>opulent
people of Lynn were not inattentive to so fashionable and
profitable a branch of commerce.&nbsp; Some indeed, even then,
disapproved of it, and a bishop, of the name of <i>Wolfstan</i>,
is said to have firmly set his face against it at Bristol, and to
have made the people somewhat ashamed of their proceedings; but
it does not appear that they relinquished it, for Bristol
continued to be the chief English mart for slaves, long after his
time.&nbsp; His conduct, however, was highly laudable, memorable,
and exemplary; but where among our modern prelates, can we find
one that has virtue or fortitude enough to imitate the noble
example of Wolfstan!</p>
<p>How vile and mercenary must the character of those ancient
English dealers in human flesh appear, when we contemplate them
as selling their own countrymen and neighbours, and even their
kindred!&nbsp; It reminds us of what has often been said of the
modern commercial, or mercantile character: that a merchant would
sell his own father, if he could do it safely and
gainfully.&mdash;Between our ancient and modern English slave
dealers, there is some dissimilarity, though they both acted from
the same principle, and the conduct of each appears thoroughly
unjustifiable and atrocious.&mdash;The latter dealt only in
strangers, at a great distance, and of another colour; but the
former trafficked, as was before observed, in their own
countrymen, and near neighbours, brought up among them, and,
occasionally, even in their own near relations.&nbsp; Of the two,
therefore, the conduct of the ancients appears, at first sight,
as far the most unnatural <a name="page272"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 272</span>and stocking; but that will cease to
be the case, upon further consideration, and when times and
circumstances are duly attended to.&nbsp; Those ancients lived in
rude and barbarous ages, when the natural rights of man were not
understood, and when darkness visible was every where
predominant; which must, in some measure, extenuate their
misdeeds.&nbsp; But our modern slave-dealers have carried on
their operations in the open day, and in the very face of the
sun&mdash;they have adhered to this most barbarous and savage
traffick in the most enlightened age of the world&mdash;they have
persisted in it, in spite of the frequent and solemn
remonstrances of the most virtuous and enlightened of their
countrymen, and in defiance of the clearest demonstrations of the
flagiciousness of their conduct.&nbsp; They have, therefore, no
cloak for their sin, no excuse or palliating plea for their
atrocities.&nbsp; To them belongs the pre-eminence of turpitude
and infamy, and they may be said to stand at the head of those
monsters who have been a disgrace to christianity, to humanity,
and to their country.</p>
<p><i>Slaves</i> and <i>horses</i> appear to have been the
principal, if not the only articles exported from this country
during the Anglo-Saxon ages.&nbsp; Corn constituted then no
article of our exports, though it had done so formerly, in a
considerable degree, while Britain formed a part of the Roman
Empire.&nbsp; Agriculture must therefore have miserably declined
here since the arrival of the Saxons, and the country had no
reason to congratulate itself on its change of masters.&nbsp;
After the introduction of Christianity the monks are said to have
been, by much <a name="page273"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
273</span>the best husbandmen, and also the best, if not the only
gardeners in the country.&nbsp; They were certainly the most
enlightened class of the community, and the little knowledge and
learning which the country then possessed were chiefly, if not
entirely, confined within the solemn precincts of the
monasteries.</p>
<p>Of our <i>imports</i> in those days, <i>books</i>,
<i>relics</i>, <i>pictures</i>, and <i>images of saints</i>,
<i>clerical vestments</i>, and <i>church ornaments</i>, are said
to have been the chief articles; which gives but a very miserable
idea of the state of the country, and its commerce, in the mean
time.&mdash;They were however, not the only articles, for it
appears that <i>wines</i> also were imported from France and
Spain, <i>cloths</i> from Germany and Flanders, <i>furs</i>,
<i>deer-skins</i>, (and probably, <i>bear-skins</i>,)
<i>ropes</i>, <i>whale oil</i>, &amp;c. from Scandinavian and
even a portion of all the different commodities then known in any
part of Europe is supposed to have been at that period imported
to this country.&nbsp; Yet the balance of trade is said to have
been much in our favour&mdash;that is, we got much more by the
sale of our <i>Slaves</i> and <i>horses</i>, in which our exports
consisted, than what we lost or laid out in the purchase of all
the various articles which we imported, many of which, at the
same time, must have been pretty expensive.&nbsp; This seems to
imply, that those <i>Slaves</i> and <i>horses</i>, with which
foreign markets were supplied from hence, must have been very
numerous, as well as very beneficial and lucrative to our English
merchants.</p>
<p>During some part of this period the shipping of England <a
name="page274"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 274</span>seems to
have been pretty numerous; but what portion of it belonged to the
port of Lynn does not appear.&nbsp; The royal navy too, was at
times on a respectable footing, particularly in the reigns of
Alfred and Canute, as well as in those of Edgar, surnamed the
peaceable, and Ethelred: the latter is said to have possessed
near 800 sail of men of war, <a name="citation274"></a><a
href="#footnote274" class="citation">[274]</a> but they were all
what would now be called small vessels.&nbsp; The military force
of the kingdom consisted generally of about 50,000, though on
extraordinary occasions it considerably exceeded that number.</p>
<p>For a long time, <i>markets</i> were usually kept on
<i>Sundays</i>, in or near some <i>church</i>, but that being
found somewhat inconvenient, as interfering with the religious
service of the day, they were afterwards changed to
Saturdays.&nbsp; The <i>fairs</i> of those times were also
generally kept within the precincts of some great churches, or
monasteries, on some notable day, generally the anniversary of
the patron saint, and it was customary to oblige every comer to
the fair, at the gate, before he entered, to <i>swear</i> that he
would neither <i>lie</i>, <i>steal</i>, nor <i>cheat</i>: which
might be very useful, if the people had then a proper sense of
the sacredness of oaths, otherwise it would be of but little
avail, as it is to be feared it would also be in the present day,
when, from the multiplicity or commonness of oaths, a disposition
to trifle with, or make light of them is notoriously
prevalent.&nbsp; For holding these fairs, bishops and abbots
obtained charters from the crown, with a view to increase their
own revenues <a name="page275"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
275</span>by the tolls which such charters would authorise them
to levy on such occasions.&nbsp; Thus every thing contributed to
the aggrandizement of the church.&nbsp; Before the end of this
period, the clergy had possession of more than a third part of
all the land in the kingdom, with the tithes of all the rest.</p>
<p>Much attention was then bestowed on the decoration of churches
and religious houses.&nbsp; Organs and bells were introduced
toward the latter part of this period.&nbsp; The famous <i>Saint
Dunstan</i> gave a fine organ, in the reign of Edgar, to the
abbey of Glastonbury.&nbsp; Bells became very common about the
10th century, and were hung in the towers of churches, which were
then all of wood: only the altars were, it seems, built of
stone.&nbsp; The first <i>set</i> of bells in this kingdom, that
we hear of, was at <i>Croyland</i>, in Lincolnshire, in the reign
of Athelstan, a gift of the abbot <i>Turketul</i> to that
celebrated monastery. <a name="citation275"></a><a
href="#footnote275" class="citation">[275]</a>&nbsp; There had,
however, been <i>single</i> bells in England long before that
period, and even as early as the 7th century, as is attested by
<i>Bede</i>.&nbsp; In the time of M. Paris, bells were not
allowed to ring at funerals, as inspiring too gay and unsuitable
ideas.&nbsp; Clocks also began to be introduced here toward the
close of this <a name="page276"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
276</span>period.&nbsp; About the same time, the English began to
be expert and noted manufacturers of woollen cloth; the value of
a sheep&rsquo;s fleece, of course, was then well understood, and
rated at two fifths of the animal&rsquo;s whole price.&nbsp;
Silk, though now beginning to be imported, was not woven here
until some centuries afterwards: linen, in the mean time, was
extremely scarce.&nbsp; It is very remarkable, but seemingly an
unquestionable fact, that highly finished works in gold and
silver, were the production even of our darkest ages.&nbsp; The
monks, in those times, were the best artists, and the famous St.
Dunstan inferior to none of them.&nbsp; Yet the means of
supplying life with necessaries, appear to have been but
imperfectly known and cultivated.&nbsp; The pagans of Sussex, in
the 7th. century, though starving for want of food, knew not how
to catch any fish, except eels, until bishop Wilfred, who came
thither in 678, instructed them in the use of nets.&nbsp; He took
300 at a draught; and by thus supplying their bodily wants,
rendered their minds tractable to his doctrines, and easily
succeeded in their conversion. <a name="citation276"></a><a
href="#footnote276" class="citation">[276]</a>&mdash;Our modern
missionaries to the south sea isles, and other foreign parts,
would do well to imitate his example, and not confine their
attention or labours solely to religious instruction.&nbsp; A
goodly pattern of the same kind has also been very lately set
before them among the North American Indians by the <i>Quaker
missionaries</i>.&nbsp; But it is to be feared that they and
their employers are too wise in their own eyes to profit by such
examples.</p>

<p>Of the population of Lynn, at any time during that long
period, from the establishment of the Saxons to that of the
Normans, no estimate can now be formed; but it is pretty certain
that the major part of its inhabitants, as well as those of the
adjacent country, and of all the rest of England, were
<i>Slaves</i>, during the whole of that time, and long
after.&nbsp; Those unfortunate people, for the most part at
least, appear to have been the descendants of the original
inhabitants, who were reduced to that condition, at the
subjugation, of conquest of the country, and whose lives had been
then spared, on condition of their becoming the property, or
goods and chattels of the conquerors.&nbsp; So did the Saxons
treat those of the natives whose lives they condescended to
spare; all the rest they butchered without mercy, except such of
them as were fortunate enough to escape to the unsubdued parts of
the island.&nbsp; Of these cruel and horrid deeds, they never
appear to have repented, even after they assumed the name of
christians, for the bondage still continued; but, in time, a
severe retaliation took place, and the Saxons, in their turn,
were treated much after the same manner as they had formerly
treated the Britons.&nbsp; Long peace had <a
name="page278"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 278</span>destroyed
their martial spirit: from a very warlike people, they became
gradually a most dastardly race, and so fell an easy prey to the
ferocious Danes.&nbsp; The difference at that time between these
two nations in point of military prowess, is said to be so great
that the Saxons, alias the English, frequently fled before
inferior numbers of the Danes, and could hardly be prevailed upon
to meet them in the field of battle on any terms.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh
the misery and worldly shame in which England is involved through
the wrath of God! (said an English bishop in the reign of
Ethelred the unready)&nbsp; How often doth two or three troops of
Danes drive the whole English army before them from sea to sea,
to our eternal infamy, if we were capable of feeling shame!&nbsp;
But, alas! so abject are we become, that we worship those who
trample upon us, and load us with indignities.&rdquo;&nbsp; Such
was then the abject submission of the English to the insolence of
the Danes, &ldquo;that when an Englishman met a Dane on a bridge,
or in a narrow path, where he could not avoid him, he was obliged
to stand still, with his head uncovered, and in a bowing posture,
till he was out of sight.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nay, we are assured that
English submission and Danish insolence and brutality were
sometimes carried still further, and even to degrees that are
almost incredible, as well as too indelicate to relate. <a
name="citation278"></a><a href="#footnote278"
class="citation">[278]</a>&nbsp; These Danes, who now became the
instruments of retaliation and vengeance upon the Anglo-Saxons,
were remarkable for their extraordinary military skill and
intrepidity; and they were as unfeeling and ferocious as the
latter appear to have been at the time when they invaded and <a
name="page279"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 279</span>conquered
this country: they were therefore probably the fitter for the
execution of the work in which they were employed.&nbsp; Much has
been said of the cruelties committed by the Danes in this
country: they were certainly very enormous and shocking; but
there is no reason to conclude that they exceeded, or, perhaps,
even equalled those which the Saxons had before exercised upon
the former inhabitants.&nbsp; Of all the perpetrators of Danish
enormities, in this island, <i>Guthrum</i> seems to be the
foremost, or most conspicuous, in the pages of our ancient
historians.&nbsp; Of him one of them speaks thus&mdash;&ldquo;The
cruel Guthrum arrived in England <span
class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 878, at the head of an army of Pagan
Danes, no less cruel than himself; who, like inhuman savages,
destroyed all before them with fire and sword, involving cities,
towns, and villages, with their inhabitants, in devouring flames;
and cutting those in pieces with their battle-axes who attempted
to escape from their burning houses.&nbsp; The tears, cries, and
lamentations of men, women, and children, made no impressions
upon their unrelenting hearts; even the most tempting bribes, and
the humblest offers of becoming their slaves, had no
effect.&nbsp; All the towns through which they passed exhibited
the most deplorable scenes of misery and desolation; as,
venerable old men lying with their throats cut before their own
doors; the streets covered with the bodies of young men and
children, without heads, legs, or arms; and of matrons and
virgins, who had been first publicly dishonoured, and then put to
death.&rdquo; <a name="citation279"></a><a href="#footnote279"
class="citation">[279]</a>&nbsp; This is very shocking, <a
name="page280"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 280</span>and looks
like providential retaliation.&nbsp; The annals of history
exhibit many instances of the same kind.&nbsp; The Danish
warriors were always prodigal of life, and not only did not fear,
but even courted a violent death.&nbsp; A natural death they
dreaded, as a most ignoble and disgraceful end, and which they
always appeared very anxious to avoid.&nbsp; No wonder that they
became the terror of every nation against which they happened to
wage war.&nbsp; No greater evil could well befall any people than
to have them for their enemies and invaders.</p>
<p>To no part of this island did the Danes prove a greater, or
more terrible scourge than to the province of the East Angles,
which became one of their principal settlements, and where they
committed the most shocking barbarities.&nbsp; Hence we may very
safely conclude that the sufferings which the inhabitants of Lynn
experienced from them must have been exceedingly grievous and
deplorable.&nbsp; But as those sufferings have not been recorded
they cannot now be described or particularized.</p>
<p>The Danes, as well as the Anglo-Saxons, when they invaded this
country were pagans.&nbsp; Both of them afterward took up the
profession of christianity; but it was only its profession, or
bare name that they did take up.&nbsp; Their former ferocity
still remained.&nbsp; They continued grossly ignorant,
superstitious, and heathenish, and exhibited scarcely a spark of
the real spirit of the religion of Christ, except perhaps in the
latter part of the reign of Alfred.&nbsp; Their ghostly, or
religious instructors were miserable and blind guides, or knavish
and artful <a name="page281"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
281</span>impostors, who taught them that the most meritorious
actions consisted in erecting and endowing monasteries,
performing pilgrimages, and reverencing the priesthood.&nbsp;
From such pretended or pseudo-christianity, what good effect
could be expected?&nbsp; Grapes cannot be gathered of thorns, or
figs of thistles.&mdash;When Earl Alwine, who was the greatest
and richest man in England, in the reign of Edgar the peaceable,
consulted St. Oswald, bishop of York, what he should do to obtain
the pardon of his sins, the <i>sainted</i> prelate made him the
following eloquent harangue: &ldquo;I beseech your excellency to
believe that those holy men who have retired from the world, and
spend their days in poverty and prayer, are the greatest
favourites of heaven, and the greatest blessings to the
world.&nbsp; It is by their merits that the divine judgements are
averted and changed; that plagues and famines are removed; that
healthful seasons and plentiful harvests are procured; that
states and kingdoms are governed; that prisons are opened,
captives delivered, shipwrecks prevented, the weak strengthened,
and the sick healed: that I may say all in one word, it is by
their merits that this world, so full of wickedness, is preserved
from immediate ruin and destruction.&nbsp; I intreat you
therefore, my dear son, if you have any place in your estate fit
for that purpose, that you immediately build a monastery, and
fill it with holy monks, whose prayers will supply all your
defects, and expiate all your crimes.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Apostles,
no doubt, would have answered such an inquiry very
differently.&nbsp; The building of Ramsey abbey, however, as Dr.
Henry <a name="page282"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
282</span>observes, was the consequence of this fine speech. <a
name="citation282"></a><a href="#footnote282"
class="citation">[282]</a>&nbsp; Such acts were represented by
the monks as contributing greatly to the future repose of those
who did them, and of their friends; whence it was usual for all
those who had any sense of religion, or concern, for their
salvation, to bequeath some part of their estates <i>to their own
souls</i>, as they called those bequests which they made to a
church or a monastery.</p>
<p>To promote and establish an unbounded veneration for the
priesthood, miraculous tales were industriously propagated, and
as readily believed; for the credulity of the people perfectly
suited the knavery of the priests.&nbsp; The following talc, or
rather miracle, is related by William of Malmsbury, in the very
words, as he says, of one of the persons on whom it was
wrought:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I Ethelbert, a sinner, will give a true
relation of what happened to me on the day before Christmas,
<span class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 1012, in a certain village,
where there was a church dedicated to St Magnus the martyr, that
all men may know the <i>danger of disobeying the commands of a
priest</i>.&nbsp; Fifteen young women and eighteen young men, of
which I was one, were dancing and singing in the church-yard,
when one Robert, a priest, was performing mass in the church; who
sent us a civil message, intreating us to desist from our
diversion, because we disturbed his devotion by our noise.&nbsp;
But we impiously disregarded his request; upon which the holy
man, inflamed with anger, prayed to God and St. Magnus, that we
might continue dancing and singing a whole year, without
intermission.&nbsp; His <a name="page283"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 283</span>prayers were heard.&nbsp; A young
man, the son of a priest, named John, took his sister, (who was
singing with us) by the hand, and her arm dropped from her body
without one drop of blood following.&nbsp; But notwithstanding
this disaster she continued to dance and sing with us a whole
year.&nbsp; During all that time we felt no inconvenience from
rain, cold, heat, hunger, thirst, or weariness; and neither our
shoes, nor our clothes wore out.&nbsp; Whenever it began to rain,
a magnificent house was erected over us, by the power of the
Almighty.&nbsp; By our continual dancing we wore the earth so
much, that by degrees we sunk into it up to the knees, and at
length up to the middle.&nbsp; When the year was ended, bishop
Hubert came to the place, dissolved the invisible ties by which
our hands had been so long united, absolved us, and reconciled us
to St. Magnus.&nbsp; The priest&rsquo;s daughter, who had lost
her arm, and other two of the young women, died away immediately;
but all the rest fell into a profound sleep, in which they
continued three days and three nights; after which they arose and
went up and down the world, publishing this true and glorious
miracle, and carrying the evidence of its truth along with them,
in the continual shaking of their limbs.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A formal deed, attesting the truth of this ridiculous story,
was drawn up and subscribed by bishop Peregrine, the successor of
Hubert, <span class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 1013. <a
name="citation283"></a><a href="#footnote283"
class="citation">[283]</a>&nbsp; William of Malmsbury also, the
most sensible of our old historians, appears to have given it
full credit.&nbsp; In short, it seems very certain that it was
long, in common with abundance of other similar tales,
universally believed; which shews <a name="page284"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 284</span>how well established the authority
of the priesthood, and the popular reverence for that order, must
then have been in this country, and here at Lynn, as well as in
other places.</p>
<p>Next to the priests and monks, the magicians and
fortunetellers appear to have then possessed the largest share of
the public confidence and veneration; and very probably with
equal worthiness.&nbsp; Strange tales have been related by
historians of the ascendancy which these sorts of people long had
over the infatuated inhabitants, and even over those of the
highest orders among them.&nbsp; These things give but an
unfavourable idea of our national character in those times.&nbsp;
It would but ill become us, however, to think very contemptuously
of those foibles in our poor ancestors, while we ourselves with
all our boasted advantages and wisdom, have not yet entirely left
off consulting fortunetellers and conjurers: to say nothing of
the multitude of other impostors, of different sorts, that are
daily countenanced and caressed among us.</p>

history&mdash;remarks on Egbert</i>, <i>Alfred</i>, <i>and their
most renowned successors&mdash;character of Canute</i>, <i>and of
Edward the Confessor</i>: <i>the latter the first of our monarchs
that touched for the Evil&mdash;remarks on that circumstance</i>,
<i>and on the prevalence of that complaint in the parts about
Lynn</i>.</p>
<p>During a good part of the period from the Saxon invasion to
the conquest, England was divided into seven <a
name="page285"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 285</span>petty
states, or kingdoms, usually denominated, the Heptarchy, <a
name="citation285"></a><a href="#footnote285"
class="citation">[285]</a> the history of which is exceedingly
uninteresting; being, as Granger observes, a series of violence,
wars, and massacres, among petty tyrants, most of whom were a
disgrace to the human species.&mdash;Under the famous Egbert
those states were consolidated, and formed into one kingdom,
under the name of England, which it has borne ever since.&nbsp;
The kings who have ruled it, from Egbert to the Norman conqueror,
were, for the most part, like their predecessors in the days of
the Heptarchy, very disreputable and worthless characters.&nbsp;
There were however, some exceptions, among which Alfred was far
the most conspicuous, and outshone the rest, as the sun does all
the other luminaries.</p>
<p>Among the most renowned and respectable of the other English
sovereigns of that period, beside Egbert, already mentioned, were
Edward the elder, Athelstan, Edgar the peaceable, Edmund
ironside, Canute the great, and Harold the second.&nbsp; Of Edgar
we are told, that he styled himself <i>King of Great Britain</i>,
as Edred, it seems, had done before him; but that title was
afterward discontinued, and not used by any succeeding monarch,
till the reign of James the first.&nbsp; The most potent among
these crowned heads was Canute, being the sovereign of Denmark
and Norway as well as of England.&nbsp; That he possessed great
talents is allowed on all hands; and though he was cruel here at
first, he gradually became mild, devout, and popular.&nbsp;
Though an usurper and <a name="page286"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 286</span>a foreigner, he was, perhaps, next
to Alfred, the wisest of our ancient kings, if not also the most
virtuous and enlightened, especially towards the close of his
reign: of which his memorable adventure, or experiment with the
tide, and with the miserable sycophants of his court, on the
seashore, seems a pretty strong indication.&nbsp; That he was
also superstitious, and an admirer of relics, must not be denied:
but it was likewise the case with all the most eminent of the
princes of those days, the great Alfred himself not
excepted.&nbsp; There is a remarkable air of honest simplicity in
the reason given by Canute for undertaking a voyage, or journey
to Rome, which he did a few years before he died:&mdash;&ldquo;I
had been told (said he) that the apostle Peter had received great
authority from the Lord, and carried the keys of heaven:
therefore I thought it absolutely necessary to secure his favour
by a pilgrimage to Rome.&rdquo;&mdash;How many of our modern
visionaries and devotees would appear more respectable than
Canute, were they as honestly to avow their motives, or give the
reason of their proceedings?</p>
<p>In adverting to the princes, or sovereigns of this period, to
whom the town of Lynn was in subjection, Edward, called the
Confessor, must not be left unnoticed: not so much for any
shining qualities, or great respectability of character which he
possessed, for there he appears to have been very deficient, as
for certain incidents or events which distinguished his reign,
independent of any personal worth or merit of his own.&nbsp; With
the monks and ecclesiastics he was certainly a great favourite,
but what made him so redounded not at all to his honour, <a
name="page287"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 287</span>but may be
said to be a disgrace, rather than any credit to his memory.</p>
<p>The most important and laudable occurrence of his reign was
the reformation of the law of the land.&nbsp; Before his time
different parts of the kingdom were governed by different laws:
Wessex, by the West Saxon; Mercia, by the Mercian; and
Northumberland, by the Danish laws.&nbsp; In his reign they were
reduced into one body, by the name of the laws of Edward the
confessor, which then became common to all England.&nbsp; This
together with the abolition of that odious tax called
<i>Danegelt</i>, seem to have been his best and most commendable
deeds, though probably to be ascribed to his counsellors, such as
Goodwin, Leofric, and Siward, rather than to himself.&nbsp; It is
said, however, that he was humane, temperate, and charitable, and
gave much alms: and, moreover, that he had visions and
revelations, the gift of prophecy, and even that of working
miracles, his extensive fame for which continued long, and
procured him, about two hundred years after his death, from pope
Alexander III. the high honour of canonization, under the name of
<i>Saint Edward the Confessor</i>, an appellation that must have
been very oddly and unaccountably applied.</p>
<p>But of all his memorable achievements, or traits of character,
his <i>touching</i> for the Evil, or Scrofula, and pretending to
the gift or power of miraculously healing that complaint, are the
most remarkable.&nbsp; As this pretended gift or power is
supposed to have originated <a name="page288"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 288</span>with him, <a
name="citation288a"></a><a href="#footnote288a"
class="citation">[288a]</a> and to have descended from him to all
his legitimate successors on the English throne, a sketch of the
history of the practice, from first to last, it is presumed,
would not prove unacceptable or unentertaining to the
reader.&nbsp; And as the disorder, for whose cure this practice
was introduced, is said to be nowhere more common, or prevalent,
than at and about Lynn, <a name="citation288b"></a><a
href="#footnote288b" class="citation">[288b]</a> which is
supposed to have been also the case for many generations, it may
naturally and safely be concluded that frequent applications to
the throne for a cure would be made, time after time, from these
parts, while every body believed that the sovereign&rsquo;s
<i>touch</i> would infallibly remove the malady.&nbsp; Myriads
and myriads, labouring under scrofulous complaints, have
certainly applied to the throne for relief during the long
interval between the time of the Confessor, when the said
practice commenced, and the accession of George I. when it was
finally laid aside.&nbsp; Even in the single reign of that
<i>most religious</i> prince (as he has been called) Charles II.
the number, it is said, amounted to <i>above ninety thousand</i>;
and it is morally certain that not a few of that multitude, and
of the rest, who resorted, before and since, to our different
sovereigns, for relief in the same case, were Norfolk and Lynn
patients.&nbsp; The insertion therefore, in this volume, of the
proposed Sketch of <a name="page289"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
289</span>this notable affair, or practice of the royal touch,
cannot, it is presumed, be deemed any material deviation from
propriety:&mdash;so it shall appear in the last section of this
chapter, at the conclusion of this second part of the work.</p>

<p>In the time of the Confessor, as he has been already
suggested, Lynn was a place of considerable and growing
consequence.&nbsp; The town then, and the adjacent country
belonged to three of the principal men of the realm.&nbsp;
Harold, who afterwards ascended the throne, was then Earl, or
Duke of the East Angles, <a name="citation289"></a><a
href="#footnote289" class="citation">[289]</a> which must have
placed Lynn under his jurisdiction.&nbsp; He had <a
name="page290"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 290</span>besides,
great possessions here, being chief proprietor and lord of South
Lynn and other places.&nbsp; Great Massingham, Westacre &amp;c.
did also belong to him.&nbsp; Stigand, archbishop of Canterbury,
likewise bore then no small sway in this town and neighbourhood,
as lord of Rising, &amp;c.&nbsp; So also did his brother Ailmer,
bishop of Elmham, to which see, even at that early period, the
government of the borough of Lynn seems to have been a kind of
appendage.&nbsp; These two prelates were Anglo-Saxons, which was
the case, it seems, with but three more of the order in the
kingdom; <a name="citation290"></a><a href="#footnote290"
class="citation">[290]</a> the rest being all foreigners, and
mostly French, or Normans.&nbsp; These being his countrymen, and
in a manner his subjects, we need not wonder at the facility with
which the Conqueror obtained the English Crown; especially as the
Pope also patronized the undertaking.&nbsp; Though those bishops
could not prevent the accession of Harold, owing to his great
popularity and power, yet they kept themselves ready to promote
the cause and interest of his rival whenever a fair opportunity
should offer, and it was not long before they had their wishes
completely gratified.</p>
<p>Harold during the latter part of the Confessor&rsquo;s reign
was the most powerful subject in the kingdom.&nbsp; He possessed
also great talents and courage, with no small share of ambition,
and had acquired vast and unrivalled popularity.&nbsp; It was
therefore no great wonder that he should pretty easily make his
way to the throne at the very first vacancy.&nbsp; He had had for
sometime the chief management of public affairs, and his conduct
in <a name="page291"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 291</span>the
mean while appears to have given general satisfaction.&nbsp; No
one in the kingdom was better qualified, or perhaps more
deserving than he to wear the crown; and whatever the Norman, or
monkish historians may have said to the contrary, it seems pretty
certain that he ascended the throne with the general assent and
approbation of the people.</p>
<p>His reign however, was soon disturbed, first by a Danish, or
Norwegian invasion in the north, beaded by Harfager, or Helfager
king of Norway, aided by Harold&rsquo;s own worthless brother
Tosti; and shortly after by a French invasion in the south, under
William the bastard, Duke of Normandy.&nbsp; The former Harold
opposed with success; the invaders were defeated with great
slaughter, and the two chiefs, Harfager and Tosti, fell in the
action.&nbsp; Great and rich booty is said to have fallen into
the hands of the victors, including a considerable quantity of
gold.&nbsp; Here Harold appears to have committed a great error,
and to have departed most unwisely and unaccountably from his
usual policy, by retaining all the spoil for himself, instead of
sharing it with his soldiers, which excited great discontents
among them, and proved afterwards, in no small measure,
detrimental to his cause.</p>
<p>No sooner had the English monarch triumphed over the first
invaders than he learnt that the Duke of Normandy with a great
army had made good his landing in Sussex.&nbsp; He immediately
commenced his march against that fierce and formidable adversary,
with an army greatly reduced by the late bloody, though
successful <a name="page292"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
292</span>conflict, and rendered discontented by his own
impolitic and unwise conduct, already mentioned.&nbsp; Yet
notwithstanding those disadvantages, so rapid was his progress
from Yorkshire to Sussex, that he actually arrived within sight
of his enemies before they had proceeded but a little way from
the place of debarkation.&nbsp; It had been better, no doubt, had
he taken more time, to refresh and recruit his army, or acted on
the defensive, for sometime at least, which could hardly have
failed of being very materially to his advantage, as he was then
circumstanced.&nbsp; But so impetuous was he, and resolute to
bring the contest to a speedy termination, that he absolutely
rejected the wholesome counsel given him by one of his brothers,
to adopt a different course.&nbsp; To his opponent this must have
been perfectly agreeable, and the very thing he wanted, as
nothing could have been less his interest than a defensive war on
the part of the English, or to find in Harold another
<i>Fabius</i>.&nbsp; Both parties accordingly prepared for a
speedy and decisive engagement.&nbsp; The two armies are said to
have spent the preceding night very differently: the English
impiously passed it in riot and revelry; but the Normans, good
creatures! were all the time occupied in the duties of religion;
for which, to be sure, from the nature of their errand, and the
object of their visit, they must have been preeminently
qualified!&nbsp; This story, we may presume, was fabricated
afterwards by the monks and priests and Norman historians, who
were in the interest of the Conqueror, and wished to pay their
court to the reigning family.&nbsp; Be that as it might, the
battle of Hastings forms a memorable era in the history of this
<a name="page293"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
293</span>country.&nbsp; Both armies fought with desperate
valour, as if determined to conquer or die; but the invaders
proved victorious.&nbsp; Harold and his two brothers, with the
flower of the English army, fell in that bloody and fatal field;
and that single victory may be said to have placed the conqueror
on the throne of England, and advanced him to the first rank
among the European potentates of that age.&nbsp; In promptness,
decision, military and political talents, as well as good
fortune, he may be said strongly to resemble the present
sovereign of Normandy and the French Empire.&nbsp; But it is to
be hoped that the resemblance will not hold, in case the latter
should ever attempt to accomplish his long threatened invasion of
this kingdom.</p>
<p>From the disastrous and fatal field of Hastings, Edwin and
Morcar, the principal surviving English commanders, with the
shattered remains of Harold&rsquo;s army, retreated in the night
to London, where they convened the people, and such of the
grandees of the realm as were there to be found, to consult upon
the best mode of proceeding, at so critical and desperate a
conjuncture.&nbsp; They themselves were for placing Edgar
Atheling, the next heir, on the throne, and adopting vigorous
measures for the discomfiture and expulsion of the invaders; but
their advice was not taken, their reasons were set at nought, and
every idea of any further resistance was abandoned; so that
William obtained the crown without fighting another battle, or
encountering any further difficulty.&nbsp; Nothing could exceed
the pusillanimity, or dastardly conduct of the English on that
memorable <a name="page294"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
294</span>occasion, instead of the present prevailing and
flattering idea, that one Englishman can beat two or three
Frenchmen, they seemed to believe, on the contrary, that one
Frenchman could beat, at least, two or three Englishmen.&nbsp; In
short, they appear to have erred as much on the one hand as we do
on the other.&nbsp; But it was not the only time when our dear
countrymen discovered a diffidence of their own superiority.</p>
<p>The blame of rejecting the counsel of the two chieftains
above-mentioned has been imputed to the defection and
machinations of the bishops and clergy, who, as has been already
suggested, were decidedly in the interest of the Norman, and, of
course, inimical to the Anglo-Saxon or English, government,
constitution, and succession.&nbsp; The chief reasons for which,
were probably the following&mdash;1. Many of them, and most of
the bishops were foreigners, and William&rsquo;s countrymen and
subjects; so that it was natural for them to favour his
enterprize and pretensions.&mdash;2. Ecclesiastical power and
priestly domination were more likely to be promoted, and the
popular, or opposite spirit depressed and crushed under a Norman,
than an Anglo-Saxon, or English government.&mdash;3. Even under
the Confessor, monk-ridden and priest-ridden as he was, the civil
power was so formidable, and superior to the ecclesiastical, that
the parliament actually procured the deprivation and banishment
of <i>Robert</i>, archbishop of Canterbury, as an incendiary and
fomenter of disputes between the king and his subjects, and had
<i>Stigand</i> appointed in his room: a change therefore, or such
a revolution <a name="page295"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
295</span>in the constitution and government as William was
likely to effect or promote, must have been a desirable object
with the whole clerical body.&mdash;4. The Pope had openly
appeared in favour of the invasion, the success of which he was
understood to have much at heart: and so careful had he been to
let all see that William was his man, and the church&rsquo;s
favourite and champion, that he first made him a present of a
consecrated standard, a golden Agnus Dei, and a ring, in which
was pretended to be one of St. Peter&rsquo;s hairs; (of course a
most precious relic;) and then he solemnly excommunicated all
that should oppose him.&nbsp; This conduct or example of the pope
would alone have been sufficient lo influence and determine the
bishops, clergy, and monks, or the whole body of the
ecclesiastics, to betray and sacrifice the cause of the people,
or of the nation, and promote to the utmost that of the
invader.&nbsp; They would have done so without any other reason
or inducement; but being further stimulated by those before
mentioned, we may safely conclude that their zeal in the
disgraceful cause which they had so basely espoused, must have
been of no ordinary fervour.</p>
<p>This memorable co-operation of the clergy with the conqueror,
so hostile to the liberty and independence of the country, has
been pronounced, in a recent publication, to be &ldquo;the true
origin of the <i>alliance between church and state</i>, so much
contended for by some of our ecclesiastics; who have renounced
the penances of popery, but would fain retain both its pride and
its power.&rdquo; <a name="citation296"></a><a
href="#footnote296" class="citation">[296]</a>&nbsp; <a
name="page296"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 296</span>But if it
was really its origin here, yet it seems to have begun elsewhere
at a much earlier period: for the world does not appear to have
existed a very long while before statesmen and priests found it
to be their interest to play into each others hands, and enter
into partnership, for the better management of their respective
concerns; or, in other words, for the sake of keeping the
multitude more easily and effectually in subjection.</p>
<p>The papal presents and interference in favour of the Norman
expedition, despicable as they appear, must have largely
contributed to recruit William&rsquo;s forces, inspire them with
confidence and enthusiasm, and eventually promote and ensure his
success.&nbsp; Nor was he himself wanting on his part.&nbsp;
Nothing that an intrepid adventurer, and able leader could do to
give effect to his undertaking was by him omitted.&nbsp; He even
went so far as to make very liberal promises to divide the lands
of the English among his followers, in case he proved victorious;
which promises he afterwards very punctually and amply performed,
so that the English grandees were deprived of their possessions,
or if they were permitted to retain any part of them, they held
the same under the Normans, who then became every where the great
lords and proprietors of the country.</p>
<p>The whole English nation, in the meantime, was so completely
subdued and degraded, as to become, like the ancient Gibeonites,
mere hewers of wood and drawers of water for their haughty
conquerors, whom providence seemed to employ, like the Danes
before, as <a name="page297"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
297</span>instruments of retaliation and vengeance, for the
atrocities formerly committed on the original inhabitants.&nbsp;
The English language itself was now in a manner prohibited and
proscribed, and the <i>French</i> substituted for it, or
introduced in its room, especially in the courts of law, and all
legal transactions, which continued to be the case for a long
time. <a name="citation297"></a><a href="#footnote297"
class="citation">[297]</a>&nbsp; French also became now the sole
language of gentlemen, or of all who moved in the high and polite
circles.&nbsp; None could be admitted into such circles, or
allowed the name of gentlemen, without that language, which bore
very hard, no doubt, upon many an English buck of those days;
hence that well known old proverb, &ldquo;Jack would be a
gentleman, but that he can talk no French.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The changes which the Norman Conquest produced in this country
shall be further noticed in the next part or division of this
work, where it will be seen how Lynn in particular, and its
vicinity were affected by that memorable and humiliating
revolution.</p>
<p>During the period of which we have been treating, Lynn
exhibited no appearance of a borough, or corporate <a
name="page298"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 298</span>town: that
state, or order of things belonged to the policy of a subsequent
period, and resulted from the revolution effected by the
conquest, and the odious feudal system, for their attachment to
which the Normans were so very remarkable.&nbsp; Of the
population of Lynn before the conquest, a great part probably
consisted of <i>slaves</i> of different descriptions, the vassals
and property of the bishop and other great men.&nbsp; The
artificers, tradesmen, and merchants of Lynn were then all,
perhaps, in that condition, and following their respective
employments or professions, by the permission, and under the
protection or patronage of their lordly superiors and
proprietors, and also for their, as well as their own behoof or
emolument.&nbsp; It is not very clear or probable that the
condition of these people and of the rest of their unfree or
enslaved countrymen, did or could, by the conquest, suffer any
very material deterioration.&nbsp; But with their superiors, the
high and mighty, or great men of the land, their lordly and
unfeeling oppressors, the case is known to have been far
otherwise: that event, like some modern conquests and
revolutions, degraded and humbled them with a vengeance.</p>

<p>It is generally agreed that this notable practice, which
appears to have been long deemed as a branch of the <a

prerogative, began in this kingdom with, or in the person of

appeared very partial to it, and fond of French fashions, might
take the hint from thence, and introduce it here upon his
accession to the throne, which he might easily manage by the help
of the monks, with whom he was so great a favourite.</p>
<p><i>Clovis</i>, and <i>Robert</i> of sainted memory, are named
among the early French sovereigns who successfully practised the
royal touch, and were greatly admired and venerated by their
subjects on that account.&nbsp; In the reign <i>of Philip</i> the
first, the virtue is supposed to have been somehow lost, but
happily revived again with undiminished splendor in that of Lewis
the fat, after which it seems to have long and regularly
continued.&nbsp; Francis I. <a name="citation299b"></a><a
href="#footnote299b" class="citation">[299b]</a> and Henry IV.
are represented as eminent practitioners; how it was with the
succeeding monarchs, descended from the latter, we are not
informed.&nbsp; No particular attention appears to have been paid
to it yet by the emperor Napoleon.&nbsp; What he may think proper
to do <a name="page300"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
300</span>hereafter, no tongue can tell.&nbsp; Whether he
possesses this power or not, it is certain that he possesses some
other powers in as great a degree, at least, as any of his royal
or imperial predecessors.</p>
<p>But this miraculous gift of healing did not, it seems, belong
exclusively to the kings of France and England. <a
name="citation300a"></a><a href="#footnote300a"
class="citation">[300a]</a>&nbsp; The Earls, or princes of the
house of Hapsburg also, are reported to have had it in no scanty
measure.&nbsp; They cured the strumous, or scrofulous, it is
said, by giving them drink, and the stammerers, by kissing
them.&nbsp; But the Kings of Hungary seem to have exceeded all;
for we are told that they <i>could</i> cure, not only the
king&rsquo;s evil, but all disorders occasioned by poison, the
bite of a viper, or any other venomous animal.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Mr. <i>Bel</i>, who tells us this, observes
(what is as remarkable as the account itself) that he cannot find
in history, that these Hungarian kings ever exercised this
wonderful power. <a name="citation300b"></a><a
href="#footnote300b" class="citation">[300b]</a>&nbsp; More shame
for them, the unfeeling wretches! if they possessed it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The case was otherwise with the royal doctors of France
and England, who have not been so shy of exerting this power, or
rather, of practising this quackery.&nbsp; <a
name="page301"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 301</span>Some French
writers (says Carte) ascribe this gift of healing to the
king&rsquo;s devotion towards the relics of St. Marculf, in the
Church of Corbigny, in Champagne, to which the kings of France,
immediately after their coronation at Rheims, used to go in
solemn procession: and it must be owned there was formerly a
great veneration paid to this saint in England.&nbsp; It was in
memory of him that a room in the palace of Westminster frequently
mentioned in the rolls of parliament, was called the chamber of
St. Marculf; being probably the place where our kings touched for
the Evil.&nbsp; It is now (our historian adds) called the painted
chamber: and though the name of that saint hath been long forgot
in this nation, yet the sanative virtue of our kings still
continues.&rdquo; <a name="citation301a"></a><a
href="#footnote301a" class="citation">[301a]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of the most noted among our sovereigns, as practitioners in
this healing art, the following is thought a pretty complete
list.&nbsp; Nothing seems to be known in this way of Harold II.
or yet of the four succeeding princes; but that Henry II.
practised very successfully is said to be attested by Petrus
Blesensis, who had been his chaplain. <a
name="citation301b"></a><a href="#footnote301b"
class="citation">[301b]</a>&nbsp; It seems highly probable that
Henry III. likewise was often applied to, and successfully
practised in the same way, as John of Geddesden, a physician, who
is said to live about that time, advises a scorfulous patient,
after his remedies had proved ineffectual, to apply <a
name="page302"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 302</span>to the king
for a cure: for which he has been much blamed, and seemingly not
without reason, as, in case he deemed the royal touch a certain
care or remedy, he ought to have sent the patient to the king at
first, without troubling him with operation and medicine. <a
name="citation302a"></a><a href="#footnote302a"
class="citation">[302a]</a></p>
<p>Henry&rsquo;s great son, Edward I, also appears to have been
no mean master of this same art; and so, probably, might be his
son, Edward II, though otherwise no great conjuror; but as to his
son, Edward III, few, if any, seem to have gone beyond him in
this sanative employment.&nbsp; <i>Bradwardine</i>, who attended
him in his wars, and whose counsel is said to have contributed to
his success, gives a pompous advertisement, in his book <i>De
Causa Dei</i>, of the wonderful cures wrought by that
prince.&nbsp; <i>F. le Brun</i>, however, pays no regard to
this.&nbsp; He looks upon it as a crafty stratagem, and says, he
does not doubt but that Edward&rsquo;s pretensions to the crown
of France excited his zeal to touch those who were diseased;
which is not unlikely; princes often, when nothing but politics
lie at the bottom, chusing to make religion to swim on the top.
<a name="citation302b"></a><a href="#footnote302b"
class="citation">[302b]</a>&nbsp; Edward&rsquo;s grandson,
Richard II, cannot be supposed to drop or lay aside a practice
for which his grandfather and immediate predecessor on the throne
had been so celebrated.&nbsp; Nor is it at all likely that his
successors, of the rival house of Lancaster, should discontinue
this practice, as that might have been construed to imply a
consciousness of inferiority to the princes of the other house,
or something like a defect in their own title to the crown.</p>
<p><a name="page303"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 303</span>Least
of all is it to be supposed that this practice should be dropt or
neglected afterwards, on the restoration of the York line, in the
person of <i>Edward IV</i>, who would naturally take care to
exercise every prerogative or power supposed to have belonged to
his ancestors, and which had any way contributed to their
popularity, consequence, or celebrity.&nbsp; This monarch, though
of a far less religious or devout cast than his immediate
predecessor Henry VI. might not on that account be the less
qualified to work these miracles, any more than <i>Charles
II.</i> afterwards; who, though by his clerical subjects
denominated <i>most religious</i>, was yet certainly, in fact,
one of the <i>most irreligious</i> and profligate wretches that
ever wore a crown: nevertheless he unquestionably practiced the
<i>royal touch</i>, as extensively, effectually, and successfully
as any one whatever in the whole list of our crowned, or kingly
practitioners.&nbsp; And why not?&mdash;as the extraordinary
gift, supernatural virtue, or miraculous power, belonged
entirely, it seems, to his regal quality or dignity; <a
name="citation303"></a><a href="#footnote303"
class="citation">[303]</a> and had nothing at all, apparently, to
do with his personal or moral character.</p>
<p><i>Richard</i> III. also, after he ascended the throne, may be
supposed to possess as much of this supernatural and <a
name="page304"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 304</span>sanative
virtue (whatever may be said of the other virtues) as any one of
his predecessors or successors; and as it was evidently his
interest to omit no popular observance, and to avail himself of
whatever had a tendency to excite or gain the admiration of the
people, and reconcile them to his government, we may be sure he
would not fail to follow, with spirit, the practice in question;
and so, by a copious display of its sanative virtue, compensate,
in some sort, or degree, for the absence of virtues of another
description.&nbsp; There is therefore abundant reason for setting
him down among our royal miracle-workers.</p>
<p>None of all these princes appear to have made a greater
figure, or to have proceeded with more parade, solemnity, and
success, in this royal business or occupation, than Henry
VII.&mdash;This politic prince, whatever right he might have to
the crown, had probably as good a right as any one to try his
hand at this notable and wonder working operation, the effect or
fame of which he knew full well how to manage profitably and turn
to the best account.&nbsp; He accordingly set about it in good
earnest; and in order, as may be supposed, to give the process
the most striking, sacred, and solemn appearance, and increase
its effect, he had a new form, or office, composed and introduced
for the purpose. <a name="citation304"></a><a href="#footnote304"
class="citation">[304]</a>&nbsp; <a name="page305"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 305</span>The project answered; and his
success in this practice is said to have been very
considerable.&nbsp; This prince would also sometimes take upon
him to <i>convert heretics</i>; <a name="page306"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 306</span>and he would even give them money to
facilitate their conversion; <a name="citation306"></a><a
href="#footnote306" class="citation">[306]</a> which was
certainly no illadapted device, or unpromising expedient; and it
is the more remarkable, <a name="page307"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 307</span>as his majesty was himself so great
a lover of money, and appears to have been so exceedingly
close-fisted on other occasions.&nbsp; We may therefore be very
sure that the conversion of heretics was of the highest
importance in Henry&rsquo;s estimation, and what lay very near to
his royal heart.&nbsp; This monarch also, with his queen and
eldest son, visited the town of Lynn, where he very probably
exercised the <i>royal touch</i>, as scrofulous patients may be
supposed to have been then, as they are now, very numerous here,
all of whom, as well as the rest of the inhabitants, would not
fail to give full credit to his majesty&rsquo;s ability to remove
the malady and restore the patients to perfect health; and, of
course, would be anxious to apply to him, which he would not be
likely to discourage.&nbsp; As to <i>heretics</i>, there might be
then none of them here for him to try his royal hand at their
conversion.</p>
<p>His son and high spirited successor, <i>Henry VIII</i>, would
doubtless be careful to continue the practice of all the rites
and ceremonies appertaining to the royal function, which had been
handed down to him from his father: and there is every reason to
believe that the operation in question would not be forgotten or
omitted, were it only to be even with his neighbour and rival,
<i>Francis I</i>, who certainly performed it, and would not <a
name="page308"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 308</span>be likely
to be suffered or allowed to go beyond him on such an
occasion.&nbsp; Henry therefore may be safely set down among our
said royal practitioners, and even among the most able and
powerful of them all.&nbsp; But the <i>King&rsquo;s Evil</i> was
not the only Evil in whose cure or removal he was particularly
concerned: He was no less concerned in the cure or removal of the
<i>Pope&rsquo;s Evil</i>, another dreadful malady, which had long
and grievously afflicted most of the good people of this country,
and which was generally deemed incurable, till he took it in
hand.&nbsp; All the world know how powerfully and effectually
<i>his royal touch operated</i> on that occasion.&mdash;It seems
he had also the reputation of being endowed with extraordinary
gifts for the cure or prevention of the <i>cramp</i>; and we find
that he distinguished himself by the consecration of <i>cramp
rings</i>, which Stephen Gardiner says were much esteemed every
where, and often sought for. <a name="citation308"></a><a
href="#footnote308" class="citation">[308]</a>&nbsp; So very
eminent was Henry among our royal doctors, and miracle
mongers.</p>
<p><i>Edward VI</i>, Henry&rsquo;s amiable son and successor, is
not known to have been at all an adept at this princely practice,
or even to have been in the least partial to it.&nbsp; He
probably thought so very lightly of it as entirely to omit and
discard it, as he is also said to have done with respect to the
<i>consecration of cramp rings</i>, by which his royal father so
much distinguished himself.&nbsp; It is likely that Edward, young
as he was, had imbibed some sectarian notions which might unfit
him for the performance of these sublime operations.&nbsp; Even
the royal <a name="page309"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
309</span>and episcopal work of <i>burning heretics</i>, so much
approved of and delighted in by his predecessors, and afterwards
by his immediate successor, and so much called for and applauded
by ecclesiastics, was to him an object of utter aversion; and if
he once suffered it to be done, it was involuntary and against
his own better judgement, through the importunate intreaties and
urgent expostulations of his bishops, and particularly Cranmer,
to whom therefore the guilt and infamy of the deed must properly
or chiefly belong. <a name="citation309"></a><a
href="#footnote309" class="citation">[309]</a>&nbsp; There is
reason to believe that no such doings would have sullied or
disgraced his reign had he been left to judge and act for
himself.&nbsp; It is probable he was left so to judge and act
with respect to the <i>royal touch</i>; so that we need not be
surprised at his declining the practice.</p>
<p>From <i>Mary</i>, his bloody sister and successor a different
conduct might be expected: and her conduct certainly was, almost
in every thing, very different from his.&nbsp; Superstitious as
she was, and bigoted to the last degree, it is not to be supposed
that she should shrink from the performance of any rite or
ceremony, however absurd, that had been in request with her
popish predecessors, or devoutly practiced by them.&nbsp; This of
the <i>royal touch</i> could never escape her attention: nay it
is <a name="page310"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
310</span>expressly said that the office was indeed fairly
written out for her use; [that very office probably, which has
been above inserted;] so that there can be no question of her
touching for the Evil, as devoutly, and as successfully perhaps,
as any of the rest. <a name="citation310a"></a><a
href="#footnote310a" class="citation">[310a]</a></p>
<p>As to <i>Elizabeth</i>, heretic as she was, her legitimacy
questioned, and her title litigated, she <i>touched</i> for the
Evil with a success acknowledged even by the papists themselves,
who are said to ascribe it to the <i>sign of the cross</i>. <a
name="citation310b"></a><a href="#footnote310b"
class="citation">[310b]</a>&nbsp; A case is mentioned by
<i>Carte</i> of a Roman Catholic, who, being put into prison,
perhaps for recusancy, and terribly afflicted with the Evil, was,
after he had been there a tedious time, at a vast expence to
physicians without the least relief, <i>touched</i> by this
queen, and perfectly cured: which gave him occasion to say, he
was now convinced by undoubted experience, that the pope&rsquo;s
excommunication of her signified nothing, since she still
continued blessed with so miraculous a quality. <a
name="citation310c"></a><a href="#footnote310c"
class="citation">[310c]</a>&mdash;It was well for the poor fellow
that he was not a <i>puritan</i>, or he might have gone long
enough without his cure, as her majesty is known to have been
inexorably pitiless and spiteful against that class of her
subjects.</p>
<p><a name="page311"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 311</span>Of
<i>James</i> I, with his strong faith in ghosts and witches, and
lofty notions of indefeasible right, royal prerogative and
king-craft, it was not to be supposed that he, of all men, would
think meanly or lightly of this royal and religious
operation.&nbsp; It accordingly appears that he very readily and
warmly engaged in it, and actually became a most dexterous and
eminent practitioner&mdash;to the no small satisfaction and
comfort, as we may suppose, of his liege subjects, as well as
advancement of his own fame, or at least, the gratification of
his vanity, of which it is well known he possessed no common or
scanty portion.&nbsp; Nothing could delight him more than the
idea that he could work miracles: his courtiers called him
<i>Solomon</i>; but that idea was calculated to make him think
himself as still greater than even Solomon.&nbsp; We are not
informed how many patients underwent or felt his royal touch; but
there is every reason to suppose and believe that the number must
have been very considerable.</p>
<p>His unfortunate son and successor <i>Charles</i> I. was no
less distinguished in this same way than his royal father had
been.&nbsp; Great numbers are said to have been by him both
touched and cured; of whom not a few were little children, which
has been urged as a proof that it could not be ascribed to the
effect or strength of imagination.&nbsp; Carte observes, that Dr.
Heylyn, an eye witness of such cures, says, &ldquo;I have seen
some children brought before the King by the hanging sleeves,
some hanging at their mother&rsquo;s breasts, and others in the
arms of their nurses, <a name="page312"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 312</span>all cured, without the help of a
serviceable imagination.&rdquo; <a name="citation312a"></a><a
href="#footnote312a" class="citation">[312a]</a>&nbsp; Both
Heylyn and Carte were full of faith in these miracles.&nbsp; If
they were right, the decapitation of Charles must have been a
great loss to the nation, and especially to those who were
afflicted with the Evil.&nbsp; For twelve years or more, after
that event, not one of these miracles appears to have been
wrought in this country.</p>
<p>As to <i>Oliver Cromwell</i>, it does not appear that he ever
tried his hand at this wonder-working operation; conscious, it
may be supposed, that it did not belong to his province, or to
the protectoral office and dignity, with which he was
invested.&nbsp; What he would have done, had he accepted or
assumed the regal title, cannot be said or known with absolute
certainty: though the probability seems to bear against his even
then becoming a practitioner, as it would hardly have met the
approbation of his best friends, or accorded with the ideas of
his most trusty and powerful coadjutors, or even with his
own.</p>
<p>After a total cessation or suspension of this ancient princely
practice, during the whole time of the Common wealth and
Protectorate, it revived again at the memorable
<i>restoration</i>; and <i>Charles II.</i> took it up vigorously
and solemnly, and on a very extensive scale.&nbsp; The Register
of the Royal Chapel is said to exhibit a list of 92,107 persons
touched by him for the Evil in a certain number of years; <a
name="citation312b"></a><a href="#footnote312b"
class="citation">[312b]</a> not including, it seems, the whole of
his reign; so that double that number, or more for aught we know,
may have passed under his hand during the whole course of his
government.&nbsp; Yet we find he <a name="page313"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 313</span>practised only at some particular
seasons of the year; at least after the summer of 1662, when a
royal proclamation was issued to inform the public that such
would be the case from thenceforth.&nbsp; His majesty had been
then a practitioner full two years, during which time there is
reason to believe that he had touched some thousands.&nbsp; He
began the work almost immediately after his restoration, so that
it may be considered among the first acts of his reign.&nbsp; Of
the state of the practice in his royal hands, or under his wise
management, a pretty accurate idea may be formed from the
following extracts&mdash;out of some of the principal Public
Papers of that era.</p>
<p>The following passage appeared in the weekly Paper called
<i>Mercurius Politicus</i>, of June 28, 1660&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Saturday being appointed by his majesty to
touch such as are troubled by the Evil, a great number of poor
afflicted creatures were met together, many brought in chairs and
flaskets; and being appointed by his majesty to repair to the
Banqueting House, his majesty sat in a chair of state, and
stroked all that were brought to him, and then put about each of
their necks a white ribbon with an angel of gold on it.&nbsp; In
this manner his majesty stroked above 600; and such was his
princely patience and tenderness to the poor afflicted creatures,
that though it took up a very long time, his majesty, never weary
of well doing, was pleased to make enquiry, whether there were
any more who had not been touched.&nbsp; After prayers were ended
the duke of Buckingham brought a towel, and the earl Pembroke a
bason and ewer; who, after <a name="page314"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 314</span>they, had made obeysance to his
majesty, kneeled down, till his majesty had washed.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was within a month after his majesty&rsquo;s arrival.</p>
<p>The next is from the <i>Parliamentary Journal</i>, of July 9,
1660; a fortnight after the other; and is thus curiously
worded&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The kingdom having for a long time been
troubled with the Evil, by reason of his majesty&rsquo;s absence,
great numbers have flocked for cure.&nbsp; His sacred majesty on
Monday last touched 250 in the Banqueting-House; among whom, when
his majesty was delivering the gold, one shuffled himself in, out
of a hope of profit, which had not been stroked; but his majesty
presently discovered him, saying, this man has not yet been
touched.&nbsp; His majesty hath for the future appointed every
Friday for the cure, at which time 200 and no more are to be
presented to him, who are first to repair to <i>Mr. Knight</i>,
the King&rsquo;s surgeon, living at the Cross Guns, in Russell
Street, Covent Garden, over against the Rose Tavern, for their
tickets.&mdash;That none might lose their labour he thought fit
to make it known that he will be at his house every Wednesday and
Thursday, from two till six of the Clock, to attend that
service.&mdash;And if any <i>person of quality</i> shall send to
him he will wait upon them at their lodgings, upon notice given
to him.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the same paper of July 30 and August 6, notice was given,
that no more would be touched till about Michaelmas: and in the
<i>Mercurius Politicus</i>, of February 28, 1661, it is said,
that <i>many came twice or thrice for the sake of the
gold</i>.</p>
<p>Another weekly paper, called <i>Mercurius Publicus</i>, <a
name="page315"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 315</span>February
21, 1661, had the following passage&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;We cannot but give notice that certain
persons (too many one would think) who having the <i>King&rsquo;s
Evill</i>, and have been <i>touched</i> by his SACRED MAJESTY,
have got the forehead to come twice or thrice, alleging they were
never there before, till divers witnesses proved the contrary;
which hath forced his MAJESTY to give order that whosoever
hereafter comes to be touched, shall first bring to his
MAJESTY&rsquo;S Chirurgeons a certificate from the
<i>Minister</i> and Church-Wardens (where they live) that they
never were touched by his MAJESTY before: the next healing will
begin six weeks hence.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the same paper of May 9, 1661, appeared the following
notice or advertisement:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;WHITEHALL.&nbsp; We are commanded to give
notice, that his MAJESTY finds the Season already so hot, that it
will be neither safe nor fit to continue his healing such as have
the king&rsquo;s Evil; and therefore that his MAJESTIES good
subjects therein concerned, would at present forbear to come to
court; Friday next (may 10,) and Wednesday (May 15.) being the
last days that his MAJESTY intends to heal, till the heat of the
weather be allayed, and his MAJESTY&rsquo;S further pleasure
known, whereof his good subjects shall have timely
notice.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The same paper of August 15, 1661, contained the passage
following:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;We are commanded to give notice That his
<i>Majesty</i> finds the season such, that it will neither be
safe nor fit to continue his Healing those that have the
King&rsquo;s Evil; and therefore that His <i>Majesties</i> good
subjects therein concerned do forbear to come to <a
name="page316"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 316</span>Court till
All-Saints Day next, till which time His <i>Majesty</i> doth not
intend to Heal.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the very same Paper, of July 17, 1662, appeared the
following curious courtly advertisement:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>Hampton Court</i>.&mdash;His Majesty
lately set forth a <i>Proclamation for the better ordering of
those who repair to the Court for cure of the disease called the
King&rsquo;s Evil</i>, wherein his Majesty being as ready and
willing to relieve the necessities and diseases of his good
Subjects by his Sacred Touch, which shall come for cure, as any
of his Royal Predecessors, in which, by the Grace and Blessing of
God, he hath in an extraordinary measure had good success, and
yet in his princely wisdom, foreseeing that fit times are
necessary to be appointed for the performing of that great work
of Charity, doth declare his Royal pleasure to be, that from
henceforth the usual times for presenting such persons, shall be
from the Feast of <i>All-saints</i>, commonly called
<i>Alhallowtide</i>, to a week before <i>Christmas</i>, and in
the month before Easter, being more convenient for the
temperature of the season, and in respect of any contagion that
may happen in this near access to his Majesties Sacred
Person.&nbsp; His Majesty doth further command that none presume
to repair to Court for cure of the said disease, but within the
limits appointed, and that such persons who come for that
purpose, bring certificates under the hands of the Parson, Vicar,
or Minister and Church-Wardens of the Parishes where they dwell,
testifying that they have not at any time before been touched by
the King; further charging all Justices of Peace, Constables,
&amp;c. <a name="page317"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
317</span>that they suffer not any to pass but such as have such
Certificates, under pain of his Majestys displeasure: And that
his Majesties Subjects may have the better knowledge of it, his
Majesties will is, that this Proclamation be published and
affixed in some open place in every Market Town of this
Realm.&rdquo; <a name="citation317a"></a><a href="#footnote317a"
class="citation">[317a]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To the above Extracts, only one more shall be here added, from
another Public Paper, called <i>The Newes</i>, of May 18,
1664.&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;His Sacred Majesty having declared it to be
his royal will and purpose to continue the healing of his people
for the Evil during the month of May, and then give over till
Michaelmas next, I am commanded to give Notice thereof, that the
people may not come up to the town in the interim and lose their
labour.&rdquo; <a name="citation317b"></a><a href="#footnote317b"
class="citation">[317b]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>From these premises it plainly appears that the king really
pretended to be endowed with the power or gift of working
miracles, and of healing or curing one of the most obstinate and
incurable diseases incident to the human frame, even by his
<i>touch</i>.&nbsp; Most curious and ludicrous it surely must be
to see such a man as Charles making such a pretension, and
affecting to be hand and glove with Heaven; and no less so to see
the whole nation, or at least the whole body of the church folks,
or national religionists, (clergy and laity) which constituted
the great bulk of the people, giving him full credit for every
thing, and deeming the least doubt or hesitation <a
name="page318"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 318</span>about his
miraculous claims as a sure indication of disloyalty, and
scarcely short of high treason.&nbsp; Allowing or supposing his
majesty to have really possessed this miraculous power, or
supernatural healing gift, still it must appear rather a queer
case that it should be affected by the <i>temperature of the
seasons</i>, and actually controlled, overpowered, and crippled,
as it were, by the <i>hot weather</i>; and that the royal
operator, in the meantime, in case he persisted in his benevolent
practice, or labour of love, during the dog-days, and for some
time before and after, should be exposed to the imminent danger
of some alarming <i>contagion</i>: at least he and his courtiers
seemed evidently to have had such apprehension.&nbsp; In all
this, however, his loyal and admiring subjects could discover
nothing, either marvellous or suspicious, or yet any way
inconsistent.&nbsp; Their sovereign&rsquo;s miraculous claims
found in them the most ready acquiescence.&nbsp; With some,
indeed, especially among the poor persecuted nonconformists, the
case was otherwise.&nbsp; They disbelieved those royal
pretentions.&nbsp; But it only served to strengthen the public
prejudice against them; being generally looked upon as an
additional and sure proof of their disaffection, or their moral
and political depravity.&mdash;So much for Charles&rsquo;s
supernatural powers and miraculous deeds.</p>
<p>His brother and successor, <i>James</i> II. another of our
<i>religious</i> monarchs, continued this practice with unabated
zeal, solemnity, and devotion.&nbsp; He appears to have made some
improvement in the process; particularly by restoring the sign of
the cross, which had <a name="page319"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 319</span>been unaccountably omitted by his
father, and grandfather.&nbsp; It is probable that none of its
ancient appendages were by him forgotten, or left unrestored, if
he did not also, in his princely wisdom, devise some others,
equally suitable and edifying: and had the crown continued in his
family, the good subjects of these realms would hardly have
failed of having the institution or practice still preserved
amongst them, and observed in all things according to the pattern
exhibited by him.&nbsp; But his unexpected abdication forced
things into another channel, and deprived us of so fair and
important a chance.&nbsp; James is supposed to have practised at
Whitehall as frequently, in proportion to the length of his
reign, as his brother had done.&nbsp; But as his reign, compared
with that of Charles, was very short, (though, in some respects,
much too long) it is not to be supposed that he, like the other,
could boast of his myriads of patients and cures.&nbsp; It
appears, however, that he was very assiduous in this business, as
well when his occasions called him abroad, as when detained
within the precincts of his own court or palace: hence when he
went to Oxford in 1687, about the affair of Magdalen-College and
other matters, part of his time there is known to have been
employed in <i>touching</i>; which shews how very partial he was
to the practice, and how very ready he was to attend to it on
every occasion that might offer. <a name="citation319"></a><a
href="#footnote319" class="citation">[319]</a>&nbsp; <i>Dr.
Sykes</i> in a letter to <i>Dr. Charlett</i>, of September 4,
1787, expresses himself thus, &ldquo;This morning the king
<i>touches</i> in Christ Church Quire; hears one Father Hall this
morning <a name="page320"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
320</span>at the new Popish Chapel there; but whether he will be
there in the afternoon, or at University College, I know
not.&rdquo;&nbsp; And <i>Creech</i> in a letter to <i>Dr.
Charlett</i>, of September 6, the same year, says, &ldquo;On
sunday morning the king <i>touched</i>.&nbsp; <i>Warner</i> and
<i>White</i> officiating: all that waited on his majesty kneeled
at the prayers, beside the Duke of Beaufort, who stood all the
time.&rdquo; <a name="citation320"></a><a href="#footnote320"
class="citation">[320]</a>&nbsp; All this shews how partial and
devoted James was to this practice, as well as how obsequiously
the learned Oxonians observed and contemplated this part of their
Sovereign&rsquo;s conduct.&nbsp; Had he not gone beyond this
royal <i>touch</i>, neither the Magdalenians nor any other
Oxonian fraternity had ever resisted his mandates: his
popularity, in that case, might have been as unbounded as that of
our present sovereign, and his descendants might have reigned
here gloriously to this day.</p>
<p>At the Revolution this practice or operation was again
suspended.&nbsp; <i>William</i> III. was a Presbyterian, and
<i>Oliver Cromwell</i> an Independent: the spirit and principles
of these sects seem not to be congenial with, or favourable to
the practice; nor does this gift or privilege appear to extend to
sectarian or heterodox princes, but only to those of the Romish,
or Church of England faith.</p>
<p>At the accession of <i>Anne</i>, of course, this sanative
virtue and practice again revived, and numbers were
<i>touched</i> by the royal hand of that illustrious princess,
among whom was the late celebrated <i>Dr. Samuel Johnson</i>,
then in his childhood.&nbsp; At the death of Anne, the <a
name="page321"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 321</span>said virtue
forsook the British throne: at least none of our succeeding
monarchs have yet ventured to revive the practice.&nbsp; The two
first princes of the present dynasty had, doubtless, their
reasons for refraining from it; but as it is not known what they
were, it is impossible to say whether their majesties were
governed therein by wise or unwise, proper or improper
motives.&nbsp; We know that actions very right in themselves may
yet be performed upon very wrong and unjustifiable
principles.&nbsp; There is, however, no room to suppose that
these two potentates were in any measure influenced in this
instance by what their enemies, the Jacobites, would be ready to
insinuate: an apprehension of their own title to the Crown being
defective.&nbsp; The voice of the Nation (than which, there can
be no better title) had placed them on the throne of these
realms.</p>
<p>His present majesty has hitherto followed the example of his
two immediate predecessors, in not restoring or resuming this
dormant or neglected branch of the royal prerogative.&nbsp; If he
ever should hereafter, at any time, think proper to restore or
resume it, there can be no manner of doubt of his meeting with
ample success, as well as abundant employment.&nbsp; In that case
it may be presumed that multitudes of patients would soon be
flocking in from all quarters, not excepting the County of
Norfolk and the parts about Lynn Regis.&nbsp; His resolving to
resume the practice would instantly occasion the revival of the
national faith in the efficacy of the operation; and so far would
such a resumption or experiment be from <a
name="page322"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 322</span>endangering
his majesty&rsquo;s fair fame and popularity, that it would, in
all probability, augment the same, and so render him for the
residue of his reign, within the British Isles at least, more
popular and more celebrated than ever.&nbsp; But as we are not
warranted to expect that his majesty will ever try the
experiment, or put to the test the faith of his subjects in the
miraculous efficacy of his <i>touch</i>, we shall here drop the
subject as far as it may concern him.</p>
<p>It appears that after the death of queen <i>Anne</i> it was
firmly believed by a great part of the nation, that the sanative
virtue, or miraculous power which she was allowed to possess,
still existed in the person of a certain exiled prince of her
family.&nbsp; In proof of which a story was industriously
propagated of one <i>Christopher Lovel</i>, of Bristol, who being
most sadly and grievously afflicted with the Evil, after having
recourse to the most eminent of the faculty, and availed himself
of the best medical help in vain, went at last to the Continent,
in quest of the said prince.&nbsp; Having found his royal
highness, and being kindly received, he underwent the operation
of the <i>touch</i>, got perfectly cured, and returned home safe
and sound, in full health and high spirits, after an absence of
four months and some few days.&nbsp; Carte, the historian, and
many more, gentlemen of the faculty as well as others, visited
him, examined the case thoroughly, and pronounced the cure
complete.&nbsp; Some of them, of whom one was <i>Dr. Lane</i>, an
eminent physician, considered it as one of the most extraordinary
and wonderful events that had ever happened.&mdash;After this,
who can doubt <a name="page323"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
323</span>the reality of the fact, that such a sanative virtue,
gift, or power, was actually possessed by the said
prince?&mdash;It seems, however, that the miracle did not effect
a radical cure: poor Lovel relapsed again, sometime after, and
died of the Evil at last.&nbsp; Such, in all probability, were
all the other great cures performed by the rest of our royal
doctors, although many of them, like this, were attested as
<i>perfect cures</i>, by very respectable, but too credulous
witnesses.</p>
<p>It is somewhat remarkable that <i>Whiston</i>, as well as
<i>Carte</i>, believed in the efficacy of the royal touch: the
former derives it from the <i>prayer</i> used at the time, while
the latter seems to consider it as a divine or miraculous gift
bestowed upon, or inherent to all the rightful heirs to the
English throne.&nbsp; Both of them were men of considerable
respectability, and very confident, it seems, of the soundness of
their respective opinions in this case.&nbsp; Their opinions
however appear equally untenable, and may pretty safely be
pronounced utterly unfounded.&nbsp; The favourable effects, or
apparent benefit which some of those patients might experience
after having undergone the operation of the <i>touch</i>, must
doubtless be ascribed to their own operative faith and strength
of imagination, rather than to any supernatural virtue proceeding
from that princely performance, or any miraculous gift possessed
by the royal practitioners.&nbsp; To the same cause must also be
attributed the salutary effects said to have sometimes resulted
from the pretended animal magnetism, as well as such empirical
charms and nostrums as have acquired an uncommon share of <a
name="page324"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 324</span>popular
fame, or have stood very high in the good opinion of the
public.&nbsp; A patient&rsquo;s favourable opinion of a remedy
administered to him, and his very confident expectation of
deriving from it very essential benefit, are allowed to have had
a happy effect, and to have done great things sometimes in very
serious and dangerous cases.</p>
<p>Now we may rest assured that on no other ground but this can
we reasonably account for benefits experienced by many who
underwent the royal touch; admitting that to have been really the
case; for it is too absurd to suppose that those royal personages
were actually endowed with power to work miracles, or that the
ceremony performed, or yet the gold given to the patients to wear
about their necks, had in them any supernatural or healing virtue
to render them capable of producing such effects.</p>
<p>It must be rather mortifying to our national vanity and pride,
to think that our dear ancestors, for seven hundred years, firmly
believed in the miraculous efficacy of the royal touch, in
scrofulous complaints. <a name="citation324"></a><a
href="#footnote324" class="citation">[324]</a>&nbsp; But <a
name="page325"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 325</span>while we
reprobate, or pity their stupid and miserable credulity, in this
and other instances, let us not forget that we ourselves are not
without our errors and failings, and those no less inexcusable
and degrading: witness our general belief in witchcraft,
conjuration, prodigies, and newspapers, together with the
unshaken faith of multitudes in <i>Richard Brothers</i>,
<i>Joanna Southcote</i>, <a name="page326"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 326</span>and many other notorious impostors
of different descriptions: and it may be justly questioned, if
there ever was a period when the inhabitants of this country have
been more inexcusably credulous, more easily and egregiously
imposed upon, or more generally and universally duped, than in
this very age.&mdash;But we will here close this long section;
hoping that its contents will not fail to contribute, at least in
some measure, to the amusement and satisfaction of the
inquisitive and candid reader; especially if he ever wished to
learn the history of the royal touch, of which he will find here,
perhaps, a more particular and circumstantial account than in any
other publication.</p>

<h3>CHAP. I.</h3>
<p class="gutsumm">Observations on the Conquest&mdash;account of
the changes then introduced&mdash;their effects on the kingdom at
large, and on Lynn and its vicinity in particular.</p>
<p>The conquest of England by the Normans appears to have been no
less complete than those which had been before effected by the
Romans, the Saxons, and the Danes.&nbsp; The English grandees
were generally stript of their possessions, and their lands
divided among the conqueror&rsquo;s chief favourites and great
captains, who then became the nobles of the realm, and from whom
are descended most of our present great families.&nbsp; This
conquest was obtained much easier than any of those that preceded
it.&nbsp; A single battle now determined the fate of the whole
country, partly, as was before observed, through the defection,
intrigues, and influence of the clergy, most of whom were in the
interest of the invader, <a name="page328"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 328</span>as he was supported by their holy
father the Pope, who had distinguished him by such special marks
of his favour as, could not fail of attaching them to his
cause.</p>
<p>William&rsquo;s army consisted of 60,000 men; not all his own
subjects, (for his duchy could not furnish and maintain such a
force) but made up chiefly of adventurers, or soldiers of
fortune, who had engaged in the expedition, on the promise of
forfeited lands, in proportion to the numbers they brought with
them.&nbsp; Accordingly, some are said to have afterward bestowed
on them no less than 700 manors, others 5, 4, 3, 2, and 100, or
less; insomuch that all the land in England, if we except the
royal demesnes, the church lands, and those annexed to the cities
and boroughs, were in no more than about 700 hands, whose wide
possessions were again distributed among their numerous vassals,
according to the principles of the feudal system, which was now
completely introduced and established in England. <a
name="citation328"></a><a href="#footnote328"
class="citation">[328]</a></p>
<p>In consequence of this change, it became a fundamental maxim,
and necessary principle of our English tenures, that the king is
the universal lord and original proprietor of all the lands in
his kingdom, and that no man doth or can possess any part of it,
but what has, mediately or immediately, been derived from him, to
be held upon feudal services.&nbsp; This engrafting of the feudal
tenure on almost all the land in the kingdom, is said to have
been the most important alteration which <a
name="page329"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 329</span>our civil
and military policy then underwent. <a name="citation329a"></a><a
href="#footnote329a" class="citation">[329a]</a>&nbsp; The great
lords held their lands of the king, by certain services, as all
their vassals held theirs also of them.&nbsp; Thus the king had
the whole power of the country closely connected with, and
dependent upon himself.&nbsp; This state of things was
calculated, no doubt, to secure the kingdom from external danger,
and may be considered as laying the foundation of that high
military character which England afterwards held among its
neighbours.</p>
<p>A vast demesne was now set apart for the king, amounting to
1422 manors, together with many other lands which had never been
erected or formed into manors.&nbsp; Besides these he had the
profits of all his feudal tenures, his worships, marriages, and
reliefs; the benefit of excheats, either upon failure of heirs,
or forfeiture; the goods of felons and traitors; the profits of
his courts of justice; besides many other casualties, which
amounted to an immense revenue; insomuch that the Conqueror, as
we are informed, had no less than 1060<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i> a
day, the annual amount of which, allowing for the comparative
value of moneys &amp;c. was equal to several millions (perhaps
twenty or more) of ours. <a name="citation329b"></a><a
href="#footnote329b" class="citation">[329b]</a>&nbsp; So large a
revenue might probably justify the saying of Fortescue, that
originally the King of England was the richest in Europe.</p>
<p>We are told, that William&rsquo;s military tenants were
obliged, on all occasions, to furnish 60,000 knights, completely
equipped, and ready to serve forty days at <a
name="page330"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 330</span>their own
expence.&nbsp; Every seaport also, in proportion to its ability,
was obliged to find, in time of danger, one or more ships
properly furnished with men and arms; which, joined with such
other ships as the king hired were generally an overmatch for the
invaders. <a name="citation330"></a><a href="#footnote330"
class="citation">[330]</a>&nbsp; Thus we see how powerful and
formidable England became after the conquest, in its means of
defence and resistance, under its Norman sovereigns.</p>
<p>Whilst we are noticing the changes now introduced into this
country, it may not be improper to observe, that the feudal
system was a favourite branch of the Norman policy, and which
they appear carefully to have established wherever they could get
a firm footing.&nbsp; They did so, not only in Normandy and
England, but also in <i>Sicily</i>, which they appear to have
subdued much about the time of which we are now speaking, and
which has groaned under the oppression of that System ever since,
even to this day.&nbsp; Of the commencement of that order of
things in that island, and its present aspect and bearings, a
very recent writer gives the following account, which may serve
to cast some light on the state of our country at the period now
under consideration.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Roger the Norman, conqueror of Sicily, and
contemporary with our William the First, on his accession to the
throne, divided the lands of the kingdom into three
portions&mdash;One third of these was called the demesnes of the
Crown, which are administered by the corporation of the royal
towns where they are situated; each town, according to the
revenue of its demesnial <a name="page331"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 331</span>lands, pays to the king a certain
income, besides maintaining the police, roads, &amp;c. &amp;c.
and the tribute which each territory pays is called the royal
patrimony.&mdash;The next third part of these lands was
distributed by King Roger among his nobles; some of these were
fiefs contained within the territory of the demesnial towns,
while others had a town of their own, of which the estate or
barony formed the territory.&nbsp; Sometimes townships of these
baronial towns have estates belonging to them, which are
administered by their corporations, called giurati.&mdash;The
remaining third portion was either distributed among the bishops
and mitred abbots, or served to endow the several Convents, which
in an age fertile in superstition were so generally
established.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This distribution of property has remained thus ever
since the Norman Conquest; and all the noble fiefs, as they are
held by a grant in military tenure, are supposed to belong to the
crown, and given to a family and their descendants, subject to
military service.&nbsp; This Circumstance supposes an absolutely
strict entail, which prevents the sale of fiefs without the
king&rsquo;s sanction; (verbo regio;) it supposes also the
indivisibility of the fief&mdash;hence the rights of
promogeniture, which has reduced the younger branches of families
to a most miserable state.&nbsp; Thus the lands of the nobles are
entailed in their families.&nbsp; Those of the church are
attached to it, and the demesne lands are equally so to the
corporations, as above-mentioned.&rdquo; <a
name="citation331"></a><a href="#footnote331"
class="citation">[331]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page332"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 332</span>Of
the orders of Society in Sicily, the same writer says&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Those princes, dukes, marquisses, and
barons, who hold estates which have a town, or sufficient
population, are called parliamentary barons, and have a right to
sit in the assembly of the nobles: all others are called rustic
fiefs, and give no right of this kind to their landlords, though
they be decorated with a title.&mdash;The next order of men are
the clergy, who form a distinct assembly or house of parliament,
and consists of archbishops, bishops, archimandrites, mitred
abbots, &amp;c.&nbsp; The principal of these are younger brothers
of the noble families; so that, in fact, the ecclesiastical house
of parliament is tied to the lords.&mdash;The next order of men
consists of a second rank of nobles, who hold fiefs without
burghs, or towns, and who, though they have the same splendid
titles, have no seat in the parliament.&nbsp; The next order are
the burghers of the different towns; these apply to agriculture,
to the church, and to the medical and legal professions: then
come the artisans and peasants.&nbsp; These are the peasants of
the demesne, and those who are the vassals of the parliamentary
lords.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After noticing the multiplied miseries under which the bulk of
the people is involved by this wretched order of things, which
forms an insuperable obstacle in the way of national happiness
and prosperity, our author informs us, that, according to the
original constitution of Sicily, the three houses of parliaments
have the faculty of granting supplies to the Crown; but the
majority of the two houses (he says) are sufficient; by which
means the house of commons, or demesnial assembly <a
name="page333"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 333</span>becomes
totally nugatory, and the lords and ecclesiastics, after
generously granting the supplies, throw the whole burden of them
on the commons.&nbsp; Whatever remonstrances are made, the matter
is left to the decision of those who have done the evil, and the
mischief is thus perpetuated: <a name="citation333"></a><a
href="#footnote333" class="citation">[333]</a> for it seems they
never think of yielding in the least to the remonstrances of the
commons, or complaints of the people.</p>
<p>In Sicily the feudal system exists without its original
energies; and it may be said to exist in its very worst state, so
as to spend all its force in oppressing beyond measure the middle
and lower orders of the community, or great body of the nation,
without contributing to the real benefit of any.&nbsp; The
consequence is that the people, for the most part, groan
hopelessly under their burdens, and seem perfectly indifferent
about the issue of the present contest with France.&nbsp; Yet
some people seem to wonder at their supineness, and their not
rising as one man in defence of their king and country.&nbsp;
They might probably have done so, had their rulers been wise, and
left them what would have been worth contending for, or
defending.&nbsp; When rulers cease to feel for the people, it is
not unnatural or unusual for the people also to cease to feel for
them.&nbsp; This, perhaps, will apply to many of the recent
changes among the European powers.</p>
<p>Beside the feudal system, our Norman conqueror introduced into
this country divers other innovations&mdash;One of which was the
separation of the Spiritual courts <a name="page334"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 334</span>from the Civil; which was effected
(says Blackstone) in order to ingratiate the new king with the
popish clergy, who for sometime before had been endeavouring all
over Europe to exempt themselves from the secular power; and
whose demands the conqueror, like a politic prince, thought it
prudent to comply with, by reason that their reputed sanctity had
a great influence over the minds of the people; and because all
the little learning of the times was engrossed into their hands,
which made them necessary men, and by all means to be gained over
to his interests.&nbsp; And this was the more easily effected,
because the episcopal sees being then in the breast of the king,
he had taken care to fill them with Italian and Norman
prelates.&nbsp; This innovation produced very grievous
consequences; so that by degrees the rights and privileges of the
English clergy were delivered up into the hands of the Pope, who
taxed them at his pleasure, and in process of time drained the
kingdom of immense treasures: for besides all his other dues,
arising from annates, first fruits, peter-pence, &amp;c. he
extorted large sums of money from the clergy for their
preferments in the church.&nbsp; He advanced foreigners to the
richest bishopricks, who never resided in their dioceses, nor so
much as set foot upon English ground, but sent for all their
profits to a foreign country; nay so covetous was his Holiness,
that before livings became void, he sold them provisionally among
his Italians, insomuch that neither the king nor his clergy had
any thing to dispose of, but every thing was bargained before
hand at Rome. <a name="citation334"></a><a href="#footnote334"
class="citation">[334]</a></p>
<p><a name="page335"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
335</span>Another grievous innovation, introduced at the same
period, consisted in the depopulation of whole countries for the
purposes of the king&rsquo;s royal diversion; and subjecting both
them and all the ancient forests of the kingdom to the
unreasonable severities of forest laws imported from the
continent, whereby the slaughter of a beast was made almost as
penal as the death of a man.&nbsp; In the Saxon times, though no
man was allowed to kill or chase the king&rsquo;s deer, yet he
might start any game, pursue, or kill it, upon his own
estate.&nbsp; But the rigour of these new constitutions vested
the sole property of all the game in England in the king alone;
and no man was entitled to disturb any fowl of the air, or beast
of the field, of such kinds as were specially reserved for the
royal amusement of the sovereign, without express licence from
the king, by a grant of a chase, or free warren: and those
franchises were granted as much with a view to preserve the breed
of animals as to indulge the subject.&nbsp; From a similar
principle to which, though the forest laws are now mitigated, and
by degrees grown entirely obsolete, yet from this root has sprung
a bastard slip, known by the name of the <i>game law</i>, now
arrived to and wantoning in its highest vigour: both founded upon
the same unreasonable notions of permanent property in wild
creatures; and both productive of the same tyranny to the
commons; but with this difference, that the forest laws
established only one mighty hunter throughout the land, the game
laws have raised a little Nimrod in every manor. <a
name="citation335"></a><a href="#footnote335"
class="citation">[335]</a></p>
<p><a name="page336"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
336</span>Another innovation produced by the conquest was,
&ldquo;narrowing the remedial influence of the country-courts,
the great seats of Saxon justice, and extending the original <a
name="page337"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
337</span>jurisdiction of the king&rsquo;s justiciaries to all
kinds of causes arising in all parts of the kingdom.&nbsp; To
this end the <i>Aula-regis</i>, with all its multifarious
authority, was erected; and a capital justiciary appointed, with
powers so large and boundless, that he became at length a tyrant
to the people, and formidable to the crown itself.&nbsp; The
constitution of this court, and the judges themselves who
presided there, were fetched from Normandy: and the consequence
naturally was, the ordaining that all proceedings in the
king&rsquo;s courts should be carried on <i>in the Norman</i>
[<i>or French</i>] <i>instead of the English
language</i>:&mdash;a provision the more necessary, because none
of his Norman justiciaries understood English; but as evident a
badge of slavery as ever was imposed upon a conquered
people.&rdquo;&nbsp; And yet the nation was obliged to <a
name="page338"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 338</span>submit to
it and bear it, for ages.&nbsp; The former plainness and
simplicity now gave way to the abstruseness, chicanery, and
subtilty, which have ever since so unhappily characterized our
legal proceedings. <a name="citation338a"></a><a
href="#footnote338a" class="citation">[338a]</a></p>
<p>Another of the hateful innovations of the same memorable
period was, the introduction of the <i>trial by combat</i>, for
the decision of all civil and criminal questions of fact in the
last resort.&nbsp; This was the immemorial practice of all the
northern nations, but first reduced to regular and stated forms
among the Burgundi, about the close of the fifth century: and
from them it passed to other nations, particularly the Franks and
the Normans; which last had the honour to establish it here,
though clearly an unchristian, as well as most uncertain method
of trial.&nbsp; But it was a sufficient recommendation of it to
the conqueror and his warlike countrymen, that it was the usage
of their native duchy of Normandy. <a name="citation338b"></a><a
href="#footnote338b" class="citation">[338b]</a>&nbsp; This vile
remain of ancient barbarism, and foul disgrace of the legal
polity of our ancestors, has long ceased to exist in our
island.</p>
<p>As the general changes introduced by the conqueror must have
affected the inhabitants of Lynn, in common with the rest of
their countrymen, the above sketch of them became necessary, in
order to give the reader some idea of the state of things here at
and subsequent to the conquest.&nbsp; Before and at that period,
as has been already observed, Lynn and its neighbourhood formed
part of the possessions of Harold, of Stigand archbishop of
Canterbury, and of Ailmar bishop of Elmham.&nbsp; All <a
name="page339"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 339</span>the
possessions of the former, of course were forfeited by the
conquest.&nbsp; Those of the two others soon followed; for being
both Anglo-Saxons, (or Englishmen,) and deemed inimical to the
Norman succession, they were both expelled, and their sees filled
by foreigners.&nbsp; Ailmar&rsquo;s power and possessions here
were in right of his see, and of his lordship of Gaywode, which
had been long attached to that see: those of Stigand were in his
own right, or that of his lordship of Rising, and that of the
hundred of Freebridge, which he held, (as well as the lordship of
the hundred of Smithdon, and many other lordships,) as a lay
fee.&nbsp; His possessions in these parts were bestowed by he
conqueror on his half brother Odo, bishop of Bayeux, in Normandy,
whom he created Earl of Kent.&nbsp; On his rebellion afterward
against William Rufus, he was deprived of them, and they were
bestowed on William de Albini, that king&rsquo;s butler, whose
son, of the same names, was created Earl of Sussex [of this more
may be seen in the account of Castle
Rising.]&mdash;Ailmar&rsquo;s possessions here went to his
successor Arfast or Herfast, who removed the see from Elmham to
Thetford, in whose successors they continued for many
generations.</p>
<p>Most, if not all the great gentry of England, in these parts,
and throughout the whole kingdom, at or within a few years after
the conquest, were deprived of their power, stript of their
possessions, and completely humbled.&nbsp; Great numbers of them
lost their lives under the charge of treason, sedition, or other
crimes.&nbsp; Those who escaped with their lives were reduced to
poverty, <a name="page340"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
340</span>and obliged to occupy such humble stations as they
could not one day have thought of without disdain. <a

class="citation">[340]</a>&nbsp; This memorable revolution, (as
such revolutions mostly do,) chiefly affected the higher
orders.&nbsp; It affected them, indeed, with a vengeance.&nbsp;
The middle classes seem to have felt but little of it, at least
compared with their superiors.&nbsp; The lower orders felt it
still less, or, perhaps, not at all.&nbsp; They were
<i>slaves</i> before, and so they continued for several ages
after, seemingly without any material change.&nbsp; Nor does
their hard condition appear to have been at all ameliorated till
after the civil wars broke out between the rival houses of York
and Lancaster.&nbsp; The fatal effects of those wars in reducing
the numbers of each party, obliged the leaders (as has been
before observed) to turn their attention to the lower orders,
that is to the real <i>slaves</i>, great numbers of whom were
then emancipated, to fill up the thinned and reduced ranks of
their respective armies.&nbsp; And this seems to have been the
only good that attended those bloody and destructive wars.&nbsp;
It certainly proved of great national benefit, although, like the
reformation of Henry VIII, it sprung from no virtuous or
honourable motive.&nbsp; The proverb says, It is an ill wind that
blows no good; and it may be very safely said, that seldom, if
ever, have any calamitous occurrences been known, but what have
been productive of some real benefit.&nbsp; This, doubtless, is
owing to the overruling hand of providence, and ought to be
acknowledged as such.</p>
<p><a name="page341"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 341</span>But
though the manumission of great numbers of English slaves took
place during those bloody and fatal wars, and also in consequence
of the politic and wise measures adopted by Henry VII.&nbsp; Yet
it does not appear to have been fully or universally effected, or
that slavery was then totally eradicated in England.&nbsp; We
find that there were here some slaves in the reign of Henry VIII.
and of Edward VI. and even of Elizabeth: <a
name="citation341a"></a><a href="#footnote341a"
class="citation">[341a]</a> and it may be doubtful, if they had
entirely ceased to exist here before the reign of Charles I. and
the civil war.&nbsp; They abounded in the parts about Lynn for a
very long period; but whether as late as in some other parts of
the kingdom is rather uncertain. <a name="citation341b"></a><a
href="#footnote341b" class="citation">[341b]</a>&mdash;In talking
and boasting of our great charter, and of the unwearied and
undaunted exertions of our ancient barons and patriots to obtain
and enforce it, and how careful they were on every occasion to
maintain inviolate the rights and liberties of the people of
England, we are seldom aware that a great part of the nation was
all the while in actual slavery, and not a soul among the whole
host of contemporary patriots and redoubtable zealots for
freedom, ever once thinking of pleading their cause, or
commiserating their sufferings!&nbsp; So also in more recent
times have we been congratulating ourselves on our national
virtue and ardent love of liberty and justice, while we were
every year dragging thousands and tens of thousands of the poor
Africans into west-indian slavery!!</p>

<p class="gutsumm">Further remarks on the revolutionary effects
of the conquest throughout the whole kingdom as well as at
Lynn&mdash;Catalogue of bishops who formerly bore rule in this
Town.</p>
<p>The mighty change effected in this country by the conquest
must have been felt at Lynn in common with all other places of a
similar description.&nbsp; The great and opulent were doubtless
the people who felt it most. <a name="citation342"></a><a
href="#footnote342" class="citation">[342]</a>&nbsp; As to the
middle classes, (if such there were that might properly be so
denominated,) it must have affected them much less, and the lower
orders very little, or perhaps, not at all.&nbsp; The latter were
all <i>slaves</i> before, and most unfeelingly treated by their
masters and proprietors; <a name="page343"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 343</span>and they could but be slaves still;
nor is it likely that they met with worse treatment from their
new masters.&nbsp; What might not be hoped from the virtue or
justice of the Normans, might yet be expected from their policy;
for in that quality they seem not to have been deficient; and it
may be reasonably supposed that it would induce them to use the
numerous slaves they found here no worse than they had been used
by their former proprietors.&nbsp; Thus a great part of the
nation, and perhaps the greatest part of it, might not be so very
materially affected, or injured, by the Norman conquest, as some
would be apt to imagine&mdash;if indeed it did not prove, on the
whole, a benefit rather than detriment to them. <a
name="citation343"></a><a href="#footnote343"
class="citation">[343]</a></p>
<p><a name="page344"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 344</span>We
must not however imagine or suppose that this revolution bore any
resemblance to that which took place in this country above six
hundred years afterwards, and which has been justly the fond and
proud boast of our countrymen ever since.&nbsp; They were
scarcely in any thing alike, except in the names of their
respective authors.&nbsp; But William of Normandy must not be
compared with William of Nassau; for they were two men of very
different and opposite characters: the former came over to subdue
and enslave the nation, the latter came as the champion and
guardian of its rights and its freedom&mdash;one came to rob and
destroy, the other to succour and to save&mdash;one merited the
detestation and execration, the other the esteem, the gratitude,
and the benediction of mankind.</p>
<p>Of all the English grandees, who were ruined by the conquest,
none were more completely undone than the three great proprietors
and lords of Lynn.&nbsp; One of them as has been already
observed, was king <i>Harold</i>: of his downfall we need say no
more.&nbsp; The other two were archbishop <i>Stigand</i>, and his
brother, bishop <i>Ailmar</i>.&nbsp; The former seems to have
been the elder brother and <a name="page345"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 345</span>head of the family, and was probably
of noble birth, and of Danish extraction, as the bulk of his vast
possessions lay in East Anglia.&nbsp; Carte says, that it appears
from the Domesday book, that he had the best estate of any man in
England, except Harold and Edwin: there can be little doubt
therefore of his being the head of one of the first families in
the kingdom.&nbsp; He was lord of Rising, and of the Hundreds of
Freebridge and Smithdon, and also, of divers other extensive
districts.&nbsp; He is represented as a man of no great learning,
but of eminent natural parts, improved by reflection, exercise,
and experience, and directed by a clear head and solid
judgment.&nbsp; He had the reputation of being endowed with
uncommon capacity for business; and we also hear that he was a
person of very great weight and power in the country, of which no
doubt can be entertained when his immense wealth is considered,
and the vast influence, arising from both his temporal and
spiritual dignities.&nbsp; That such a man should be marked out
as one of the victims of the Norman revolution, was naturally to
be expected: his being an Englishman, and so very opulent and
powerful, were sufficient temptations to sacrifice him.&nbsp; But
he seems to have conducted himself so warily at that critical
juncture, that the Conqueror for sometime appeared at a loss how
to proceed against him.&nbsp; At last some frivolous or pretended
ecclesiastical misdemeanor was found out, for which he was
deprived of his spiritual dignity, under the sanction of the
papal authority, by two popish legates, at a council held at
Winchester in 1070.&nbsp; This appeared a hard and severe
measure: <a name="page346"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
346</span>but William, as a politic prince, laid the whole blame
or responsibility of it on the then Pontiff, Alexander II.&nbsp;
Yet he immediately seized on Stigand&rsquo;s vast estates in East
Anglia and elsewhere, and confined him in prison on a very scanty
allowance, where it is said he died, of want, in the course of
the same year, and so did not long survive his disgrace, or
rather his downfal.&nbsp; His great possessions, in and about
Lynn, the Conqueror bestowed on his half brother Odo, bishop of
Bayeux, in Normandy, whom he created Earl of Kent, and, who then
became one of the new masters and lords of Lynn. <a
name="citation346a"></a><a href="#footnote346a"
class="citation">[346a]</a></p>
<p>Stigand&rsquo;s brother, bishop Ailmar, who had still greater
power in this town, is supposed to have been deprived, at the
same time, and by the same council.&nbsp; It is likely that he
too was then immured in a prison, and never released from it to
his dying day.&nbsp; Such has often been the fate of men who had
attained the highest honours and preferments among their
countrymen.&mdash;Ailmar was succeeded in the see of Elmham, and
in his jurisdiction and possessions at Gaywood and Lynn, by
Herfast, one of the conqueror&rsquo;s chaplains, as Rapin
says.&mdash;Here it may not be improper, or unacceptable to the
reader, to subjoin a List of the names of all the bishops that
preceded and succeeded Ailmar, as masters and lords of Lynn, from
Felix the Burgundian, first bishop of the East Angles, to Richard
Nykke, or Nix, 31st. bishop of Norwich, <a
name="citation346b"></a><a href="#footnote346b"
class="citation">[346b]</a> who surrendered into the hands of
Henry VIII. his authority or dominion over this town, when <a
name="page347"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 347</span>the name of
it was changed from <i>Bishop&rsquo;s</i> <span
class="smcap">Lynn</span> to <i>King&rsquo;s</i> <span
class="smcap">Lynn</span>, which it has retained ever
since.&mdash;Those bishops were,</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Felix</span> <i>the
Burgundian</i>.&nbsp; He was the apostle of the East Angles,
among whom his ministry was attended with eminent success, and
issued in the conversion of the whole nation: schools were
consequently instituted, and numerous places of worship erected
throughout the whole country.&nbsp; He was consecrated their
bishop in 630, and fixed his seat first, it seems, at
<i>Soham</i> in Cambridgeshire, and then at <i>Silthestow</i>,
afterwards called <i>Domnoc</i>, and since <i>Dunwich</i>, in
Suffolk.&nbsp; He has been represented as very learned and
pious.&nbsp; The fame of his uncommon sanctity was so great, that
after his death, which happened in 647, he was canonized as a
saint, and his festival stands on the 8th of March, in the Romish
calendar.&nbsp; (See more of him above at p. <span
class="indexpageno"><a href="#page242">242</a></span>.)&mdash;His
immediate successor was <span class="smcap">Thomas</span>, who
had been trained up under the famous <i>Paulinus</i> archbishop
of York, to whom he had been appointed deacon.&nbsp; On the
expulsion of that metropolitan from his see, Thomas served the
same office under Felix, till his death.&nbsp; After presiding
five years he died, in 653, and was succeeded by <span
class="smcap">Boniface</span>, who also sometimes goes by other
names.&nbsp; He was a native of Kent, a priest of Canterbury,
whose archbishop consecrated him, in 653; and dying in 669, he
was succeeded by <span class="smcap">Bisus</span>, or
<i>Bosa</i>, who was consecrated by Theodore, archbishop of
Canterbury.&nbsp; In his time the diocese was divided into two
sees, one of which remained at <a name="page348"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 348</span>Dunwich, and the other was fixed at
<i>North Elmham</i>, in Norfolk, among whose possessions the
demesne or lordship of Lynn and Gaywood was included.&mdash;The
bishops of Elmham, according to the best account we have met
with, were the following,</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Bedwinus</span>, or
<i>Baldwinus</i>.&nbsp; He has been spoken highly of as a man of
profound learning and exemplary virtue, and author of numerous
works (now lost) which confirmed many in the christian
faith.&nbsp; 2. <span class="smcap">Northbertus</span>, or
<i>Northbert</i>, succeeded sometime after 679.&mdash;(3) <span
class="smcap">Hedulacus</span>, or <i>Hadulac</i>, filled this
see in 731; when Bede completed his ecclesiastical
History.&mdash;(4.) <span class="smcap">Edelfridus</span>, or
<i>Ethelfrith</i>.&mdash;(5.) <span
class="smcap">Lamferthus</span>, or <i>Lameferd</i>.&mdash;(6.)
<span class="smcap">Athelwalfus</span>, or <i>Ethelwolph</i>,
occupied this see in 811.&mdash;(7.) <span
class="smcap">Ulfertus</span>, or <i>Alberth</i>: said to attend
at the council of Cloveshoe, in Berks, where King Offa proposed
erecting a new bishopric at <i>Lichfield</i>.&mdash;(8.) <span
class="smcap">Sibba</span>, or <i>Sibban</i>: he sat in
816.&mdash;(9.) <span class="smcap">Hunferth</span>, or
<i>Hunferd</i>: was living in 824.&mdash;(10.) <span
class="smcap">Humbert</span>, or <i>Humbrit</i>: it was he who
crowned king Edmund, or St. Edmund, in 856, with whom he perished
in 870, or 871, in opposing the Danes.&nbsp; He too was
canonized.&mdash;(11.) <span class="smcap">Wybred</span>,
<i>Wyred</i>, or <i>Wilbred</i>: He was set over the two sees of
Dunwich and Elmham, which occasioned their being then reunited:
the seat was fixed at Elmham.</p>
<p><i>Bishops of Elmham after the union of the
sees</i>.&mdash;(1.) <span class="smcap">Theodred</span> I.&nbsp;
He is reported to have been an eye witness of St. Edmund&rsquo;s
corpse being found uncorrupt, 70 or 80 years after his
death.&mdash;(2.) <span class="smcap">Theodred</span>, II.
surnamed <a name="page349"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
349</span>the <i>Good</i>: He was first bishop of London, and
then of Elmham; both of which he held till he died, sometime
after 962.&mdash;(3.) <span class="smcap">Athulf</span>, or
<i>Adulf</i>: succeeded in 966; or, as some think,
earlier.&mdash;(4.) <span class="smcap">Alfric</span> or
<i>Alfrid</i>: was one of those who signed and confirmed king
Edgar&rsquo;s charter to the abbey of Croyland.&nbsp; He died in
975, at the close of Edgar&rsquo;s reign.&mdash;(5.) <span
class="smcap">Athelstan</span>, <i>Edelstane</i>, or
<i>Elstane</i>: He was consecrated the latter part of
975.&mdash;(6) St. <span class="smcap">Algare</span>, or
<i>Algarc</i>: he had been Confessor to St. Dunstan archbishop of
Canterbury, and promoted to this see in 1012.&nbsp; He afterwards
resigned, and retired among the monks of Ely, where he died in
1021.&mdash;(7.) <span class="smcap">Alfwin</span>, or
<i>Elfwin</i>, succeeded the same year.&nbsp; He had been keeper
or guardian of the body or remains of St. Edmund, and afterwards
removed the same from Bury to London.&nbsp; He was also a violent
stickler for the monks, or <i>Regulars</i>, in their furious
squabbles with the <i>Seculars</i>.&nbsp; He resigned in
1032.&mdash;(8.) <span class="smcap">Alfric</span> II. succeeded,
and died in 1038; and was succeeded by&mdash;(9.) <span
class="smcap">Alfric</span> III. surnamed the <i>Little</i>, who
is said to die in 1139. <a name="citation349"></a><a
href="#footnote349" class="citation">[349]</a>&mdash;(10.) <span
class="smcap">Stigand</span>; (afterwards archbishop) he had been
chaplain to king Harold Harefoot; but having obtained this see by
simony, which his vast wealth would enable him easily to do, he
was afterwards ejected by king Hardicanute, in 1040.&mdash;(11.)
<span class="smcap">Grinketel</span>: he held it in commendam
with the bishopric of the <i>South-Saxons</i>, during the rest of
Hardicanute&rsquo;s reign.&nbsp; Under the Confessor, Stigand was
restored to favour, and promoted to Winchester, and last <a
name="page350"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 350</span>to
Canterbury.&mdash;(12.) <span class="smcap">Egelmar</span>,
<i>Ailmar</i>, of <i>Almar</i>: of whom an account has been given
already, as well as of his brother Stigand.&mdash;(13.) <span
class="smcap">Arfast</span>, or <i>Herfast</i>, chaplain to the
Conqueror.&nbsp; He succeeded at Easter, 1070.&nbsp; In
compliance with an order of a council held by <i>Lanfranc</i>,
that all episcopal sees should be removed from villages to the
most eminent cities or towns in the respective dioceses, Herfast
translated the see of Elmham to <i>Thetford</i>.&nbsp; He was by
birth a Norman, in great favour with the Conqueror, and
chancellor of England.&nbsp; He died in 1084; and in 1085 was
succeeded by (14.) <span class="smcap">William Galsagus</span>,
<i>de Bellafago</i>, or <i>Beaufo</i>.&nbsp; He also was one of
the Conqueror&rsquo;s favourites, had been his chaplain, and
became chancellor of England.&nbsp; He was, like most of that
monarch&rsquo;s great favourites, a person of immense wealth;
which at his death, in 1091, was, by his will, divided between
his family and see: and this must have contributed not a little
to augment the large possessions that were formerly attached to
this bishopric.&nbsp; In his time the celebrated survey, called
<i>Domesday</i>, was made, in which, at folio 145, is contained
an enumeration of the estates then belonging to the bishopric;
and at folio 148, is an account of the lands of the said bishop,
either in fee or inheritance.&nbsp; As many of the latter were
bequeathed to the bishopric, the revenues of the see at that
period may nearly be ascertained.&nbsp; All these were alienated
in the exchange made by Henry VIII. <a name="citation350"></a><a
href="#footnote350" class="citation">[350]</a>&mdash;After this
bishop&rsquo;s death the see was removed from Thetford to
Norwich.</p>
<p><a name="page351"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
351</span><i>Bishops of Norwich</i>.&mdash;1. <span
class="smcap">Herbert Lozinga</span>, who having, through the
favour of Roger Bigod, Earl of Norfolk, obtained, by grant and
purchase, certain lands, called <i>Cowholm</i>, commenced the
execution of his favourite plan of building a magnificent
cathedral, the first stone of which was laid by him in
1096.&nbsp; He erected a palace also for his residence, on the
north side, and a monastery on the south side, which he furnished
with 60 monks, all which doings were sanctioned by Pope Paschal
II.&nbsp; Herbert was also abbot of Ramsey, and lord Chancellor
of England; and moreover a most notorious simoniac, for which the
pope imposed upon him some heavy penances, in the doing of which
he very notably acquitted himself, and gave good proof how well
he was cut out for that kind of business.&mdash;Besides the large
edifices he erected at Norwich, he also built the two great
churches at Yarmouth and Lynn; the latter he dedicated to <i>St.
Margaret the Virgin</i>, or, as some say, to St. <i>Mary
Magdalen</i>, <i>St. Margaret</i>, <i>and all the maiden
saints</i>.&nbsp; A priory was also built by him on the south
side of this church.&nbsp; These he is said to have undertaken
<i>at the request</i> of the people of Lynn; and yet it seems as
if those same people were not otherwise very forward in their
encouragements to him; for he was obliged to have recourse to a
very ungraceful expedient in order to induce them to hasten their
contributions:&mdash;to all who would subscribe or contribute
towards these erections he offered and granted an indulgence, for
forty days; <a name="citation351"></a><a href="#footnote351"
class="citation">[351]</a> or, in other words, a <i>Licence</i>
to commit with <a name="page352"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
352</span>impunity any species of wickedness, or all manner of
sin and villany, for the space of <i>forty days</i>!&nbsp; It is
supposed that this expedient fully answered the bishop&rsquo;s
purpose; for the buildings were soon finished, in a style of
superior magnificence.&nbsp; It reflects no credit on the memory
of our townsmen of that day, that in order to do some good, or
contribute liberally towards the erection of religious edifices
in the town, they must be indulged with a licence to commit all
manner of crimes.&nbsp; It shews that they were much more
attached to evil than good, and liked sin far better than
holiness.&nbsp; How much the present population of Lynn excels
them, is a question that will not here be discussed.&mdash;Bishop
Herbert died in 1119 and was buried before the high altar of his
new cathedral.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Eborard</span>, or
<i>Everard</i>, succeeded Herbert, after a vacancy of almost
three years.&nbsp; In his time the Jews, as we are told,
crucified a boy, named William, who being considered a martyr,
and canonized, brought no small gains to the church, by the
numerous pilgrimages and offerings made annually on this
occasion.&nbsp; Though the truth of this shocking crucifixion
story seems more than doubtful, yet the monks managed to procure
it general belief, and to get the poor boy (real or fictitious)
canonized, under the name of <i>Saint William</i>.&nbsp; Their
main object no doubt was to bring grist to the mill; and as that
end was amply obtained, it may be said that they received their
reward, and did not labour (or rather invent the tale) in
vain.&nbsp; This bishop was the founder of the hospital and
church of St. Paul in Norwich; and a <a name="page353"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 353</span>great benefactor to the monastery
which had been endowed by his predecessor.&nbsp; He was deposed,
or resigned about 1146, and died at <i>Fountain</i>&rsquo;s Abbey
in Yorkshire, in 1149, and was succeeded by</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">William Turbus</span>, or
<i>Turbeville</i>.&nbsp; He was a great stickler for
<i>Becket</i>, whose influence, even while in disgrace and exile,
drove him sometimes to unwarrantable and perilous lengths;
especially when he excommunicated the bishop of London, the Earl
of Norfolk and some other nobles, who were disliked by that proud
prelate.&nbsp; He died in 1174, and was succeeded the next year,
by</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">John of Oxford</span>, who was
very differently affected towards Becket, and took part with the
king against him, by which he greatly ingratiated himself with
his sovereign; who being desirous of having the laws more
strictly executed, and a more impartial administration of justice
enforced, appointed him, together with the bishops of Ely and
Winchester, his three principal justices for the purpose.&nbsp;
He built Trinity Church at Ipswich, repaired the damages his
cathedral had sustained by fire, in the time of his predecessor,
and was a great benefactor to the episcopal convent at
Norwich.&nbsp; He died in June 1200, and was succeeded by</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">John de Grey</span>, who was
promoted to the see by that great and memorable patron of Lynn,
<i>King</i> <span class="smcap">John</span>, with whom he appears
to have been in very high favour, and from whom he procured the
liberties of Magna Charta for his diocese.&nbsp; He also obtained
<a name="page354"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 354</span>from
that monarch a charter to make his town of Lynn a free borough,
which was dated at Lutgershall, Sept. 14, 1204, the 6th year of
that reign.&nbsp; This was the first of the Lynn charters.&nbsp;
These concessions the king was induced to grant, as it is said,
either to obtain favours, or in return for some he had
received.&nbsp; The wealth of this prelate is reported to have
been of great service to the sovereign in his troubles; and for
various loans he had obtained, he pledged to the bishop his
<i>regalia</i>, viz. his great crown, the surcoat, cloak,
sandals, gloves, spurs, &amp;c.&nbsp; This bishop built the
palace of Gaywood, and so seems to have resided pretty much here,
and may be supposed to have acquired among the inhabitants a good
portion of popularity.&nbsp; We are also told that he confirmed
to the monks of Norwich our church of <i>St. Margaret</i>, and
the chapels of <i>St. James</i> and <i>St. Nicholas</i>, and the
church of <i>Mintling</i>, together with the <i>tithes</i> of
<i>Gaywood</i>, &amp;c.&nbsp; This bishop died at Poictou, in
1214: after which the see was vacant seven years; when</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Pandulphus</span>, an
<i>Italian</i>, was consecrated in 1222.&nbsp; He had been sent
to England as legate by the pope, on account of the deposition of
archbishop Langton by king John.&nbsp; While at Rome, to have his
election to this see confirmed, on his representing that it was
greatly in debt, (whether true or false, we know not,) he
obtained a grant of the whole <i>first fruits</i> of the clergy
in his diocese, for himself and successors; which thenceforth
became attached to those prelates, till the time of Henry VIII,
and must have considerably augmented <a name="page355"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 355</span>the episcopal revenues.&nbsp; He
died in Italy, in 1296; but his remains were brought to England
for interment, and buried in his cathedral.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Thomas de Blandevill</span>
succeeded him, and died in 1236, when</p>
<p>8.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Ralfo</span> succeeded, and died
the next year; of whom as well as the former, nothing remarkable
is known to be recorded.&nbsp; His successor was</p>
<p>9.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">William de Ralleigh</span>, who
obtained the bishopric after three years contesting his
right.&nbsp; He granted, we are told, an indulgence of twenty
days pardon, to all in his diocese who would contribute towards
the building of St. Paul&rsquo;s in London.&nbsp; Hence it
appears, as well as from the case of Herbert Lozinga, above
noticed, that <i>bishops</i>, as well <i>as popes</i>, in those
times, assumed the power of giving a licence to sin with
impunity.&nbsp; They must have been rare teachers of morality,
who could pretend to promote good works by allowing the people,
for a limited time, to run into all possible excesses of riot and
evil doing:&mdash;and, on the other hand, their intellects must
have been in a most unenviable and degraded state, who could
accede to the preposterous proposals of such instructors, or
patiently listen to such shameless representations.&nbsp; The
doctrine of indulgences was afterwards made good use of by Luther
and his coadjutors, in their successful struggle against the
papal tyranny.&mdash;Bishop Raleigh was translated to Winchester,
where he died, soon after his induction.&nbsp; He was succeeded
by</p>
<p>10.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Walter de Suthfield</span>, or
<i>Suffield</i>, who was consecrated in 1224.&nbsp; He obtained
for the bishopric <a name="page356"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
356</span>a charter of <i>free warren to</i> himself and
successors.&nbsp; So we may presume that he was himself a
<i>sportsman</i>.&nbsp; By the command of Pope Innocent, he drew
up a general and particular valuation of all the ecclesiastical
revenues in the kingdom; which, after receiving the papal
confirmation, was called the <i>Norwich-Inquest</i>; and
subsequently became the ratio of clerical taxation.&nbsp; He
erected and endowed the Hospital of St. Giles, in Norwich, for
poor pilgrims, and died in 1257.&nbsp; He was succeeded the next
year by</p>
<p>11.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Simon de Waltone</span>, who
died in 1265; and was succeeded the same year by</p>
<p>12.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Roger de Skerning</span>, in
whose time several dreadful affrays happened between the citizens
of Norwich and the monks, in one of which the cathedral was
burnt.&nbsp; This bishop died in 1278; and was succeeded the same
year by</p>
<p>13.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">William Middleton</span>.&nbsp;
The cathedral being partially repaired, he was enthroned at
Norwich; and he rededicated the church, in presence of the king
and queen and principal nobility, who were assembled on the
occasion.&nbsp; He died in 1288; whose successor was</p>
<p>14.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Ralph de Walpole</span>, a
Marshland man, it seems, and ancestor of the present noble family
of the <i>Walpoles</i>.&nbsp; He was translated to Ely, in 1299,
and his successor at Norwich was</p>
<p>15.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">John Salmon</span>, or
<i>Salomon</i>.&nbsp; Enlarging or rebuilding the palace at
Norwich, and founding the Charnel-house, now the free school, are
among the principal works ascribed to him.&nbsp; He died in 1385,
and his successor was</p>
<p>16.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Robert de Baldock</span>, who
resigned shortly after, and was succeeded <a
name="page357"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 357</span>by</p>
<p>17.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">William de Ayrminne</span>, who
employed himself in enclosing his palace, cathedral, &amp;c. with
stone walls, and fortifying then with embattled parapets.&nbsp;
He died in 1336; and had for his successor</p>
<p>18.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Thomas Hemenhale</span>, who
soon resigned this see, and accepted that of Worcester in lieu of
it.&nbsp; Then succeeded</p>
<p>19.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Anthony de Beck</span>, a man of
the most imperious and turbulent temper, who had terrible
quarrels with the monks, by whose instigation, as it was thought,
he was poisoned by his own servants at his seat of Hevingham, in
1343.&nbsp; His successor was</p>
<p>20.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">William Bateman</span>, dean of
Lincoln.&nbsp; He was a great benefactor to the nunnery of
Flixton in South Elmham, and gave the nuns a body of statutes for
their regulation; and, in 1347 founded <i>Trinity Hall</i> in
Cambridge, for the express purpose of supplying his diocese with
persons properly qualified for the discharge of the duties of
parochial cures.&nbsp; He died in 1354, at Avignon, while on an
embassy to the pope.&nbsp; This prelate was a native of Norwich,
but spent much of his time abroad, and chiefly at Rome, till the
pope promoted him to this bishopric.&nbsp; So great was his
interest with his holiness, that he also obtained for himself and
successors, the first fruits, as we are told, of all vacant
livings within his diocese, which occasioned, it seems, frequent
disputes between him and his clergy.&nbsp; But the clergy were
not likely to gain much by disputing with him, for he is
represented as &ldquo;a stout defender of his rights, and one who
would not suffer himself to be injured or imposed upon, or his
dignity insulted, by any one.&rdquo;&nbsp; In proof of <a
name="page358"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 358</span>which, the
following anecdote has been related of him by some of our
historians:&mdash;&ldquo;Lord Morley, having killed some of the
bishop&rsquo;s deer, infringed upon his manors, and abused his
servants who opposed him, was obliged to do penance by walking
through the streets of the city with a wax candle of six pounds
weight in his hand, and kneel down before the bishop, in the
cathedral, and ask his pardon, although the king had sent an
express order to the contrary.&rdquo;&mdash;From this anecdote we
may safely infer, that this prelate governed his slaves and
vassals, the inhabitants of Lynn, with despotic sway.&nbsp; It is
said that there was in his time such a dreadful plague in
England, and throughout Europe, as scarcely left a tenth part of
the inhabitants living; and that it appears from the Chronicle of
Norwich, that from the first of January to the first of July
1348&ndash;9, 57374 persons, besides ecclesiastics and beggars,
died in Norfolk alone.&nbsp; We cannot learn how many of them
were of the town of Lynn.&mdash;A circumstance that seems to
corroborate this extraordinary mortality is, that this bishop
instituted and collated 850 persons to benefices vacant at this
time. <a name="citation358"></a><a href="#footnote358"
class="citation">[358]</a>&nbsp; His successor was</p>
<p>21.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Thomas Percy</span>, youngest
brother of the Earl of Northumberland, though but twenty-two
years of age.&nbsp; After erecting the steeple of the cathedral,
which had been blown down by a violent wind, and repairing the
choir, which had been much damaged, he died, in 1369.&nbsp; The
next year he was succeeded by</p>
<p>22.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Henry Spencer</span>, or <i>Le
Spencer</i>, a prebendary <a name="page359"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 359</span>of Salisbury.&nbsp; He was
consecrated in March 1370, <i>by the pope in person</i>, which
probably contributed not a little to cherish that self importance
and haughtiness for which he was so remarkable.&nbsp; In an aid
granted through the kingdom to the king&rsquo;s use, this prelate
certified for his diocese, that it contained, in Norfolk 806
parishes, and in Suffolk 515; and each county was accordingly
rated.&nbsp; He took a most active part, at the commencement of
what is called <i>the grand Schism</i>, in the memorable warfare
between pope <i>Urban</i> and his competitor pope <i>Clement</i>:
for there were then two popes; two infallible heads of the
catholic church! and each reviling and damning the other without
mercy, and most bloodily seeking his destruction!!&nbsp; Bishop
Spencer was on the side of pope Urban, with whom he was in very
high favour.&nbsp; In 1383 that pontiff published a bull, in
which he called upon all who had any regard for religion, to
exert themselves in its defence, by taking up arms for him,
against his rival Clement and his adherents; promising at the
same time, for the encouragement of all who would volunteer in
this meritorious service, the same <i>pardons</i> and
<i>indulgences</i> as had been usually granted to those who had
engaged, or lost their lives, in the great eastern crusades, or
holy wars. <a name="citation359"></a><a href="#footnote359"
class="citation">[359]</a>&nbsp; This <a name="page360"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 360</span>papal bull met with no small success
in England, owing perhaps to France being on the side of pope
Clement, and to Urban&rsquo;s choosing an English ecclesiastic
for his general.&nbsp; This was our bishop Spencer, &ldquo;a
young and stout prelate (says Fox) much fitter for the camping
cure than for the peaceable church of Christ.&rdquo;&mdash;A most
dashing and bouncing high priest he certainly was; of which he
gave repeated and abundant proofs, both at home and abroad.&nbsp;
This right reverend warrior, and champion of holy church, (at
least, of Urban&rsquo;s portion or moiety of it) having obtained
an aid or subsidy, of the English parliament, set out upon his
continental expedition against the Clementines at the head of
50,000 foot and 2,000 horse: but he did not bring back quite so
many. <a name="citation360"></a><a href="#footnote360"
class="citation">[360]</a>&nbsp; Our general with his furious
crusaders, after they had landed at Calais, to shew their strict
regard for propriety and consistency, turned their arms against
Flanders; a country that was not favourable to Clement, but had
actually declared for Urban.&nbsp; After ravaging the country,
taking divers towns, and defeating the Flemish force which had
attempted to oppose them, an effectual stop was put to their
career, by the French king, Charles VI. at the head of a powerful
army.&nbsp; In short <a name="page361"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 361</span>the expedition ended disgracefully,
as it deserved, and not very unlike certain expeditions to
Flanders and Holland in modern times.&nbsp; The great general,
bishop Spencer, at his return, found himself somewhat in
disgrace; in which he proved more ill-fated than our modern Yorks
and Chathams.&nbsp; The king ordered the temporalities of his see
to be seized, and several of his officers to be imprisoned.&nbsp;
In a year or two, however, his temporalities were restored, and
he probably regained the royal favour.&mdash;He lived in great
splendor, and had divers sumptuous palaces, among which was that
at Norwich, another at South Helingham, and another, supposed to
be one of the chief of them, at Gaywood by Lynn, the inhabitants
of which town had ample experience of his imperious and turbulent
spirit.&nbsp; Being one time in town with his retinue, he
quarrelled in the street with the mayor (who was supported by the
townsmen) on some point of frivolous etiquette.&nbsp; From words
the parties came to blows, and a very serious battle ensued,
which terminated in the total defeat of the haughty prelate and
his company, who were all furiously driven out of town, many of
them sorely bruised and wounded.&nbsp; This turbulent high priest
afterwards bent his rage against the poor <i>Lollards</i>, and
appeared among the first to proceed against them upon the law
<i>De h&aelig;retico Comburendo</i>.&nbsp; He prosecuted
<i>William Sawtre</i>, minister of St. Margaret&rsquo;s at Lynn,
who at first recanted, and afterwards became minister of St.
Osith in London, where he relapsed, and was the first that
suffered under the above law.&nbsp; This bishop also afterwards
<a name="page362"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
362</span>persecuted <i>Sir Thomas Erpingham</i> at Norwich, and
as a penance, for favouring Lollardism, enjoined him to build the
<i>gate</i>, at the entrance of the College precinct, which still
goes by his name.&nbsp; Bishop Spencer died in 1406, and was, it
seems, the first prelate who quartered the episcopal arms with
his own.&nbsp; His successor was</p>
<p>23.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Alexander de Totington</span>,
who, though immediately elected, was not admitted to his
spiritualities till the following year.&nbsp; Some of his
manor-houses and palaces having fallen into decay, through the
negligence of his predecessors, he is said to have spent large
sums in repairing and beautifying them, which constituted,
apparently, his most meritorious and memorable deeds.&nbsp; He
died in 1413, and was succeeded by</p>
<p>24.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Richard de Courtney</span>,
chancellor of Oxford, who died suddenly, about two years after,
at the siege of Harfleur; from which it would seem that he was a
prelate that delighted in war, or another of our fighting
bishops, who, at the best, are but unamiable characters.&nbsp; He
was succeeded, in 1416, by</p>
<p>25.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">John de Wakeryng</span>,
archdeacon of Canterbury, who was confirmed by the
<i>archbishop</i>; which unusual circumstance was owing to the
ecclesiastical anarchy still existing, occasioned by the
continuance of the grand schism, which was then at its
height.&nbsp; During that period there always were <i>two</i>
popes, but they were now <i>three</i>, and each prefering a legal
claim to the papal chair, as the lineal descendant of St
Peter!&nbsp; Three contemporary popes exhibited an unusual and
queer spectacle, and would naturally suggest the idea of <a
name="page363"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 363</span>three heads
of the church: and a church, or any thing else, with <i>three
heads</i> may pretty fairly be deemed a <i>monster</i>.&nbsp;
Even the protestant church of England, however, has had before
now <i>two</i> heads; one in London, and the other at St.
Germans; which ought to deter its members from bearing too hard
on the church of Rome in the above case.&nbsp; Bishop Wakeryng is
said to have made considerable improvements in and about his
cathedral; which seems to have been among his most praiseworthy
performances.&nbsp; It appears that he died in 1425.</p>
<p>Here it may be proper to observe, that in this bishop&rsquo;s
time, and that of some of his predecessors, as well as of his
immediate successor, the tranquillity of the town of Lynn appears
to have been exceedingly disturbed by the violence of two
contending factions, which kept the town in a continual state of
discord and distraction, it seems, for the space of about thirty
years: as may be gathered from existing documents, or copies of
Letters, of that period, still preserved in a MS. History of
Lynn, in the possession of <i>Mr. Thomas King</i> of this town.
<a name="citation363"></a><a href="#footnote363"
class="citation">[363]</a>&nbsp; From which we discover that
those two contending factions were headed by two of the Aldermen
of that time; one of whom was <i>Bartholomy Petipas</i>, who was
<i>twice</i> mayor, and the other <i>John de Wentworth</i>, who
served that office <i>three times</i>.&nbsp; The cause and nature
of the <a name="page364"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
364</span>difference that arose between these opposing parties is
not easy to develop.&nbsp; That their animosity was bitter and
violent is but too obvious, but its source or ground is involved
in no small obscurity.</p>
<p>This however is not the place to enter minutely upon the
subject, which shall be resumed in another part of the
work.&nbsp; This dire contention seems to have begun in 1403, the
7th of Henry IV. and to have lasted till 1434, the 13th of Henry
VI.&nbsp; The first of those years were the 3rd. of
Wentworth&rsquo;s mayoralty, between whom and Petipas there
evidently existed some serious competition; but whether it was
merely a contest for power or superiority in the management of
the town, or arose from certain political questions about a
reform of abuses, on which the parties disagreed, does not very
plainly appear.&nbsp; It is however very well known that
questions of a political, as well as theological nature, were
then much agitated in different parts of the country, by the
enlightened and patriotic disciples of Wickliff, who were anxious
to promote every where political as well as ecclesiastical
reformation; but that such was actually the case then at Lynn,
and the ground of the said disagreement cannot perhaps be
positively affirmed.&nbsp; There are indeed some intimations of
<i>insufficient</i> or <i>suspicious</i> persons having for
sometime been chosen or found among the 24 Jurats that were here
annually elected, in a Letter or injunction from Henry VI,
addressed, seemingly, to the mayor and burgesses, and dated
November 23 in his 13th year, which may indicate that politics
had no small share in the said contention, <a
name="page365"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 365</span>and the
persons alluded to might belong to the advocates of reform, or
democrats of that day.&nbsp; But this subject we will now drop,
<a name="citation365"></a><a href="#footnote365"
class="citation">[365]</a> and proceed with our episcopal
catalogue.&nbsp; John de Wakeryng dying in 1425 was succeeded the
following year by</p>
<p><a name="page366"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
366</span>26.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">William Alnwick</span>,
archdeacon of Salisbury, who, having sat ten years, was
translated to Lincoln.&nbsp; The principal entrance of the palace
is said to have been <a name="page367"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 367</span>erected at his expence, and by his
arms being united with those of the see, on the west end of the
cathedral, he is supposed to have contributed towards the
erection of that also.</p>
<p>27.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Thomas Brown</span>, or
<i>Breus</i>, succeeded him, being translated hither from
Rochester, by Pope Eugenius IV. by bull, dated September 19,
1436.&nbsp; We are told that he left a sum towards the payment of
the city tax, and exhibitions for poor scholars, prosecuting
their studies in the universities, who might be natives of the
diocese: so that he seems one of the better sort of those of his
order.&nbsp; He died at Hoxne, in 1445.&mdash;<span
class="smcap">John Stanbery</span>, a carmelite friar, was chosen
to succeed him, but never consecrated, owing to papal
interference, then at its height.&nbsp; The real successor
therefore was</p>
<p>28.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Walter Hart</span>, or
<i>Lyhart</i>, master of Oriel College Oxon, who was appointed by
the pope, <a name="page368"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
368</span>and consecrated February 27, 1446.&nbsp; Paving the
cathedral; and erecting the elegant carved roof of the nave,
where a <i>hart</i>, or deer couchant, in sculpture, alluding to
his name, is seen in several places, are the works ascribed to
him.&nbsp; He died in May 1472, and was succeeded by</p>
<p>29.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">James Goldwell</span>, the
Pope&rsquo;s Prothonotary, who was made bishop by papal
provision, and consecrated at Rome by pope Sixtus IV. October 4,
1472.&nbsp; He appears to have been a thorough-paced
ecclesiastic, and legitimate son of his Holy Father.&nbsp; Before
he left Rome, at the time of his consecration, he is said to have
obtained of the Pope a <i>perpetual indulgence</i>, to repair and
ornament the cathedral; by which he was empowered to grant, to
all persons who frequented it annually, on Trinity Sunday and
Lady-day, <i>twelve years</i> and <i>forty days</i> pardon, in
lieu of offerings made on the occasion: and having received the
sum of 2200 marks, for dilapidation, he finished beautifying the
tower; made the elegant stone-fretted roof of the choir; and
ornamented the chapels on each side of it; especially that
dedicated to the Holy Trinity, in which he was afterwards
interred.&mdash;We need not wonder that he could do so much, when
he was empowered to grant such long indulgences, and such
extensive and ample pardons.&nbsp; Wealthy people, who could
believe him really possessed of such a power, might be expected
to furnish him pretty readily with any sums of money he wanted
for his sumptuous buildings and architectural decorations.&nbsp;
To such pious frauds and cunning devices, many <a
name="page369"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 369</span>of our
ecclesiastical structures, throughout the kingdom, owe much,
perhaps, of their boasted beauty and magnificence.&nbsp; Sad
however must have been the case of this country, when such vile
tricks could take, or succeed, even with the most enlightened
part of its population; and sadder still must be our case, if we
are not yet proof against equally vile and palpable
impositions.&mdash;Bishop Goldwell died in 1498, <a
name="citation370"></a><a href="#footnote370"
class="citation">[370]</a> and the see, on the refusal of
<i>Christopher Urswyke</i>, was filled by</p>
<p>30.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Thomas Jane</span>, archdeacon
of Essex, and Canon of Windsor, who was consecrated in 1499, and
died the next year: whose successor was</p>
<p>31.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Richard Nykke</span>, or
<i>Nix</i>, archdeacon of Exeter, who was elected in 1500.&nbsp;
He must have been a man of an unamiable and hateful
character.&nbsp; Writers unanimously concur to brand his name
with the greatest obloquy.&nbsp; Of his vile persecuting spirit
no further evidence need be adduced than the fact, that by his
sanguinary judgments, <i>Ayers</i>, <i>Bingy</i>, <i>Norrice</i>,
and the amiable <i>Bilney</i> were consigned to the flames, for
only, in a peaceable manner, expressing those sentiments, which,
as they were sanctioned by conscience, they had a right to
suppose were the dictates of truth.&nbsp; He died January 14.
1535.&nbsp; In his time <i>Chorepiscopi</i> were first appointed
by act of parliament; their office answering to that of
suffragan, which, prior to that <a name="page370"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 370</span>period, had been chosen at the
discretion of the diocesan.&nbsp; While this bishop bore sway, as
master and lord of Lynn, there was among the aldermen here a very
remarkable person, whose name was <i>Thomas Miller</i>.&nbsp; He
was mayor of the town six or seven years, but not six or seven
times; for the first time he was in the office for four years
successively, viz. 1520 and the three following years.&nbsp; He
was mayor again in 1529, and again in 1546, the last of Henry
VIII.&nbsp; That he was a man of spirit and intrepidity appears
by his contending with his lord, the bishop, about the right of
having the sword carried before him, which his lordship, it
seems, objected to, and claimed as his own proper and exclusive
right and prerogative.&nbsp; Our mayor and the corporation, not
satisfied with this, went boldly to law with their lordly master,
on the occasion, and carried their cause; which determined and
established the point, and the sword has been carried before
their worships, the mayors of Lynn, ever since, without any
further demur or litigation.&nbsp; It appears indeed that it
would have so happened, in no long time after, had the said
law-suit, or legal decision not taken place; for the king, in the
course of a few years, thought proper to require of this same
bishop the relinquishment and surrender of his supremacy, or
dominion over Lynn, for such valuable considerations as his
majesty, in his princely wisdom, saw fit to grant or allow him,
by way of exchange or remuneration.&nbsp; To this his lordship
readily acceded; for he must have known the king too well to
suppose that it would have been any way safe for him to have done
otherwise.&nbsp; But he died soon after, and before the affair <a
name="page371"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 371</span>was fully
concluded.&nbsp; The actual surrender, therefore, and probably
under some new arrangements, was left to be executed by his
immediate successor, the no less memorable</p>
<p>32.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">William Rugg</span>, or,
<i>Reppes</i>, fortieth abbot of St. Bennet&rsquo;s in Holme, and
native of North Repps, in this county, where his father, of both
his names, is said to have resided.&nbsp; He had his education at
Cambridge, and was fellow of Gonvill Hall in that
university.&nbsp; After being abbot of St. Bennet&rsquo;s about
six years, he was promoted to this see, by way of recompence, as
some seem to think, for the part he had acted among the Cambridge
divines, in obtaining from that university the judgment his
majesty wished, respecting his marriage with queen
Catherine.&nbsp; They might also suppose, that his being a warm
and stanch stickler for the king&rsquo;s ecclesiastical
supremacy, and influencing those of his convent to subscribe to
the same, in 1534, were additional recommendations that
contributed to his promotion.&nbsp; But when we consider the hard
terms, or humiliating conditions, on which he was to obtain, or
hold his episcopal dignity, (that is, by relinquishing the
greatest part of the revenue and possessions attached to his
see,) it will not be a very easy matter to prove that any favour
was intended by this preferment, and much less a recompence or
reward for former services: this was certainly very different
from Henry&rsquo;s wonted manner of using his favourites, and
rewarding his approved servants.&nbsp; But this point is too
uninteresting to merit any further discussion.&mdash;Abbot Rugg
being promoted <a name="page372"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
372</span>to the see of Norwich in 1536, he, by virtue of a
private act of parliament, parted with all the lands of his
bishopric, except the site of his episcopal palace in Norwich, to
the king, by way of exchange for the revenues belonging to the
abbey of Holme and priory of Hickling; which last being soon
after alienated by him, the whole income, since his time,
appertaining to the see of Norwich, has been only the estate of
Holme monastery, which his successors still enjoy, according to
the purport of the said act, which, continuing unrepealed, gave
occasion to bishop Montague, in the time of Charles I. to
subscribe himself, in his leases, &ldquo;<i>Richard</i>, <i>by
divine permission</i>, <i>lord bishop of Norwich</i>, <i>and Head
Abbot of St. Benedict&rsquo;s de Hulm</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
exchange of the lands of the bishopric, for those of the Abbey of
St. Benedict&rsquo;s and priory of Hickling, is said to have been
made by Abbot Rugg some months before his election to the see of
Norwich, <a name="citation372"></a><a href="#footnote372"
class="citation">[372]</a> though not before his promotion
thither had been predetermined.&nbsp; We are further informed
that this prelate alienated from his bishopric, not only the
priory of Hickling, but many good manors besides, belonging to
the abbey, some by absolute gift, others upon trifling exchanges,
and gave long leases, so that, at last, he was unable to maintain
the state of the bishopric, and forced to resign, with an annual
pension of 200 marks.&nbsp; He seems to have been a singularly
improvident and thoughtless prelate, and very different from most
of that order, who seldom lose sight of their terrestrial
interests, or temporal concerns, <a name="page373"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 373</span>whatever they may do as to those
that are of an eternal nature.&nbsp; After having resigned the
see for the paltry pittance of 200 marks, or, as some say,
200<i>l.</i> per annum, he died in 1550.&nbsp; In allusion to the
straits and difficulties to which his manifest and manifold
indiscretions had reduced him, one of the members or officers of
his household is said to have made the following verses on his
resignation:</p>
<blockquote><p>Poor Will, thou <i>rugged</i> art and
<i>ragged</i> all:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy <i>abbey</i> cannot bless thee in such fame,<br
/>
To keep a pallace fair and stately hall,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When gone from thence what should maintaine the
same.</p>
<p>First pay thy debts, and hence return to <i>cell</i>,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And pray the blessed <i>saint</i> whom thou dost
serve,<br />
That others may maintaine the <i>pallace</i> well;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For if <span class="GutSmall">THOU</span> stayst, we
all are like to starve.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The convent, or abbey of St. Benedict&rsquo;s, appears to have
been his chief palace, or place of residence, during the whole
time of his sustaining the episcopal character: after which it
soon went into decay, and ceased to be the residence of his
successors; with whom however we have no further concern, as they
were no longer the temporal lords and masters of Lynn.&nbsp; Here
therefore ends this episcopal catalogue; which exhibits a pretty
long list of names, though but few among them appear to have
merited the praise and benediction of their contemporaries, or
the veneration and imitation of posterity.</p>
<h3><a name="page374"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
374</span>CHAP. III.</h3>
<p class="gutsumm">State of Lynn previously and subsequently to
its becoming a corporate-town, or free borough, with general
remarks on that event, and on the progressive state of society in
the towns and cities of this country, as well as at Lynn, in
those times.</p>
<p>It is difficult to ascertain the exact state of this town, or
the nature of its police, and the social condition of its
inhabitants, not only before and at the Conquest, but also for a
good while after, any further than that its population appears to
have then consisted chiefly, if not entirely, of the
bishop&rsquo;s slaves or vassals, governed by such agents or
officers as he thought proper to appoint, whose administration as
may be reasonably presumed, would not always be of the mildest,
or most equitable and unexceptionable description.&nbsp; Had
there been now in existence regular and authentic records of the
affairs of the town, in those days, we should probably discover
that its police, at least the spirit of it, bore but too much
resemblance to our present West Indian jurisprudence.&nbsp;
Slaves, in those ages, seem to have constituted the bulk of our
population; and were, in all probability, the offspring of the
lower orders of the original inhabitants, whose lives had been
spared, when the Anglo-Saxons <a name="page375"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 375</span>over-run and conquered the country,
on condition of submitting to perpetual servitude.&nbsp; Such
seems to have been the origin of those slaves of different
descriptions which formerly abounded in this country for many
ages.&nbsp; These, in country places, were the cultivators of the
soil, or tillers of the ground; and in the towns, they were the
tradesmen, mechanics, artificers, and labourers.&nbsp; In short,
both in the towns and in country places all useful employments
were occupied by them.&nbsp; As to their masters, the nobility,
gentry, and every description of military men, who constituted
the great or main body of reputed freemen, they were all above
engaging in any such employments.&nbsp; War and the chace were
the only occupations that were deemed worthy of them; and there
lay the whole stock or sum of their knowledge and
acquirements.&nbsp; Literature of every kind they usually set at
nought; scorning to learn so much as to write their own names, as
an attainment that would be too degrading for an English
gentleman.&nbsp; Under such beings, how unenviable, miserable,
and deplorable must have been the condition of the enslaved or
unfree part of the community.</p>
<p>Of the original, low, and servile state of the inhabitants of
our English, and other European towns, and their progress from
thraldom to freedom, no one has perhaps given a juster account
than <i>Dr. Adam Smith</i>, in the second volume of his
celebrated Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of
Nations.&nbsp; He there observes that the inhabitants of cities
and towns, after the <a name="page376"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 376</span>fall of the Roman Empire, were not
more favoured than those of the country.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;They consisted, indeed, of a very different
order of people from the first inhabitants of the ancient
republicks of Greece and Italy.&nbsp; These last were composed
chiefly of the proprietors of lands, among whom the public
territory was originally divided, and who found it convenient to
build their houses in the neighbourhood of one another, and to
surround them with a wall, for the sake of common defence.&nbsp;
After the fall of the Roman empire, on the contrary, the
proprietors of land seem generally to have lived in fortified
castles on their own estates, and in the midst of their own
tenants and dependants.&nbsp; The towns were chiefly inhabited by
tradesmen and mechanics, who seemed in those days to have been
servile, or very nearly of servile condition.&nbsp; The
privileges which we find granted by ancient charters to the
inhabitants of some of the principal towns in Europe,
sufficiently shew what they were before these grants.&nbsp; The
people to whom it is granted as a privilege, that they might give
away their own daughters in marriage without the consent of their
lord, that upon their death, their own children, and not their
lord, should succeed to their goods, and that they might dispose
of their own effects by will, must, before those grants, have
been either altogether, or very nearly in the same state of
villanage with the occupiers of land in the country.&nbsp; They
seem, indeed, to have been a very poor, mean set of people, who
used to travel about with their goods from place to place, and
from fair to fair, like the hawkers and pedlers of the present
times.&nbsp; In all the different countries of Europe then, <a
name="page377"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 377</span>in the same
manner as in several of the Tartar governments of Asia at
present, taxes used to be levied upon the persons and goods of
travellers, when they passed through certain manors, when they
went over certain bridges, when they carried about their goods
from place to place in a fair, when they erected in it a booth or
stall to sell them in.&nbsp; These different taxes were known in
England by the names of passage, pontage, lastage, and
stallage.&nbsp; Sometimes the king, sometimes a great lord, would
grant to particular traders, to such particularly as lived in
their own demesnes, a general exemption from such taxes.&nbsp;
Such traders, though in other respects of servile condition, were
upon this account called Free-traders.&nbsp; They in return
usually paid to their protector a sort of annual poll tax.&nbsp;
In those days protection was seldom granted without a valuable
consideration, and this tax might, perhaps, be considered as
compensation for what their patrons might lose by their exemption
from other taxes.&nbsp; At first, both those poll-taxes and those
exemptions seem to have been altogether personal, and to have
affected only particular individuals, during either their lives,
or the pleasure of their protectors.&nbsp; In the very imperfect
accounts which have been published from Domesday-book, of several
of the towns of England, mention is frequently made, sometimes of
the tax which particular burghers paid, each of them, either to
the king, or to some other great lord, for this sort of
protection; and sometimes of the general amount only of all these
taxes.&rdquo; <a name="citation377"></a><a href="#footnote377"
class="citation">[377]</a></p>
<p><a name="page378"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
378</span>&ldquo;That part of the king&rsquo;s revenue which
arose from such poll-taxes in any particular town, used commonly
to be lett in farm, during a term of years for a rent certain,
sometimes to the sheriff of the county, and sometimes to other
persons.&nbsp; The burghers themselves frequently got credit
enough, to be admitted to farm the revenues of this sort which
arose from their own town, they becoming jointly and severally
answerable for the whole rent.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In return, being allowed to collect it in their own way, and
to pay it into the king&rsquo;s exchequer by the hands of their
own bailiff, they would be altogether freed from the insolence of
the<br />
king&rsquo;s officers; a circumstance in those days of no small
importance.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;At first, the farm of the town was lett to
the burghers, in the same manner as it had been to other farmers,
for a term of years only.&nbsp; In process of time, however,
seems to have become the general practice to grant it to them in
fee, that is for ever, reserving a rent certain, never afterwards
to be augmented.&nbsp; The payment having thus become perpetual,
the exemptions, in return for which it was made, naturally became
perpetual too.&nbsp; Those exemptions, therefore, ceased to be
personal, and could not afterwards be considered as belonging to
individuals as individuals, but as burgesses of a particular
burgh, which, upon this account, was called a Free-burgh, for the
same reason that they had been called Free-burghers or
Free-traders.&nbsp; Along with this <a name="page379"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 379</span>grant, the important privileges
above mentioned, that they might give away their own daughters in
marriage, that their children should succeed them, and that they
might dispose of their own effects by will, were generally
bestowed upon the burghers of the town to whom it was
given.&nbsp; The principal attributes of villanage find slavery
being thus taken away from them, they now, at least, became
really free in our present sense of the word Freedom.&mdash;Nor
was this all.&nbsp; They were generally at the same time erected
into a commonality, or corporation, with the privilege of having
magistrates and a town-council of their own, of making bye-laws
for their own government, of building walls for their own
defence, and of reducing all their inhabitants under a sort of
military discipline, by obliging them to watch and ward; that is,
as antiently understood, to guard and defend those walls against
all attacks and surprises, by night as well as by day.&nbsp; In
England they were generally exempted from suit to the hundred and
country courts; and all such pleas as should arise among them,
the pleas of the crown excepted, were left to the decision of
their own magistrates.&rdquo; <a name="citation379"></a><a
href="#footnote379" class="citation">[379]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the origin of corporate towns, in this country, we are
generally referred to the times of which we are now treating,
that is, the ages subsequent to the Conquest; and yet it seems to
be very evident from the old book called <i>The Mirrour</i>, that
there existed here some towns of that description <a
name="page380"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 380</span>even as
early as the days of Alfred: <a name="citation380"></a><a
href="#footnote380" class="citation">[380]</a> but they were
probably few, and disregarded afterward, if not entirely
disannulled; till a good while after the accession and
establishment of the Norman dynasty: nor can we learn scarcely
any thing of the cause and object of their formation, or the
nature and principles of their constitutions.&nbsp; The case is
otherwise as to those corporations formed since the Conquest;
which seems to apply to all those that now exist in this country:
it is not so difficult to find, or make out, how and why they
were formed; and it is with them only that we have here any
concern.&nbsp; Before they sprung up the feudal system was in its
full and utmost vigour; and the power of the country was divided
between the sovereign and the barons, or great lords; and the
latter were sometimes an over match for the former.&nbsp; As a
counter-balance or check to the formidable and enormous power of
the barons, the incorporation of the great towns and cities seems
chiefly to have been resorted to, or adopted.&nbsp; At least this
appears to have been the case as far as any good policy, and not
mere caprice, had any share in the business: for justice and
humanity, or a desire to enlarge the liberty, and promote the
welfare of the people were totally out of the question.&nbsp;
These were motives too sublime and godlike to enter into the
contemplation of the English kings and courtiers of those
days.</p>
<p>But the said measure, whatever might be its cause and object,
or the motive for its adoption, appears to have produced very
salutary effects: for by forming <a name="page381"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 381</span>cities and towns into corporations,
and conferring on them the privileges of municipal jurisdiction,
the first check was given to the overwhelming evils of the feudal
system: and under their influence freedom and independence began
to peep forth, from the rigours of slavery, and the miseries of
oppression.&nbsp; To be free of any corporation, however, was not
then, as at present, merely to enjoy some privilege in trade, or
to exercise the right of voting on particular occasions, but it
was to be exempt from the intolerable hardships of feudal
service; to have the right of disposing both of person and
property, and to be governed by laws intended to promote the
general good, and not to gratify the ambition and avarice of
individuals.&nbsp; These laws, however rude and imperfect, tended
to afford security to property, and encourage men to habits of
industry.&nbsp; Thus commerce, with every ornamental and useful
art, began first in corporate bodies to animate society.&nbsp;
But in those dark ages force was necessary to defend the claims
of industry; and such a force the municipal societies possessed;
for their towns were not only defended by walls and gates,
vigilantly guarded by the citizens, but oftimes at the head of
their fellow freemen in arms, the mayor, aldermen and other
officers, marched forth in firm array, to assert their rights,
defend their property, and teach the proudest and most powerful
baron, that the humblest freeman was not to be injured with
impunity.&nbsp; It was thus the commons learned and proved they
were not objects of contempt; nay, that they were beings of the
same species as the greatest lords. <a name="citation381"></a><a
href="#footnote381" class="citation">[381]</a></p>
<p><a name="page382"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 382</span>In
this country the king is said to be the fountain of honour; and
such he was to the incorporated towns and cities.&nbsp; From him
they derived their chartered and municipal privileges, and to him
they owed their emancipation from their former bondage, or
manumission from feudal servitude.&nbsp; Though these royal acts
appear to have proceeded from no generous or noble motives, such
as the love of justice, or a regard for liberty, but rather from
a selfish and sordid policy; yet, as they proved of vast benefit
to the inhabitants of those towns and cities, they strongly
attached them to the throne, and greatly added to the power and
resources of the sovereign.&nbsp; The aversion and contempt
manifested by the nobles towards this new body of freemen, tended
to promote still further their attachment and subserviency to the
court.&nbsp; The lords despised the burghers, whom they
considered not only as of a different order, but as a parcel of
emancipated slaves, almost of a different species from
themselves.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The wealth of the burghers never failed to
provoke their envy and indignation, and they plundered them on
every occasion without mercy or remorse.&nbsp; The burghers
naturally hated and feared the lords.&nbsp; The king hated and
feared them too; but, though perhaps he might despise, he had no
reason either to hate or fear the burghers.&nbsp; Mutual
interest, therefore, disposed them to support the king, and the
king to support them against the lords.&nbsp; They were the
enemies of his enemies, and it was his interest to render them as
secure and independent of those enemies as he could.&nbsp; By
granting them magistrates of their own, the privilege of making
bye-laws for their own government, <a name="page383"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 383</span>that of building walls for their own
defence, and that of reducing all their inhabitants under a sort
of military discipline, he gave them all the means of security
and independency of the barons, which it was in his power to
bestow.&nbsp; Without the establishment of some regular
government of this kind, without some authority to compel their
inhabitants to act according to some certain plan or system, no
voluntary league of mutual defence could either have afforded
them, any permanent security, or have enabled them to give the
king any permanent support.&nbsp; By granting the farm of their
town in fee, he took away from those whom he wished to have for
his friends, and, if one may say so, for his allies, all ground
of jealousy and suspicion, that he was ever afterwards to oppress
them, either by raising the farm rent of their town, or by
granting it to some other farmer.&rdquo; <a
name="citation383"></a><a href="#footnote383"
class="citation">[383]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The armed force, with which the towns now furnished
themselves, must have produced a very material change in the
state of the kingdom.&nbsp; This new order of warriors, or
trained bands of the towns, seem not to have been inferior to
those of the country; and as they could be more readily assembled
on any emergency, they are said to have frequently had the
advantage in their disputes with the neighbouring lords.&nbsp; In
some parts of the continent they became so powerful and
successful as to subdue the nobles in their vicinity, and enable
the cities to which they belonged to form themselves <a
name="page384"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 384</span>into
independent republicks.&nbsp; But in England, the cities and
burghs had no opportunity to become entirely independent.&nbsp;
They became, however, so considerable, as Dr. Smith observes,
that the sovereign could impose no tax upon them, beside the
stated farm-rent of the town, without their own consent.&nbsp;
They were, therefore, called upon to send deputies to the general
assembly of the states of the kingdom, where they might join with
the clergy and the barons in granting, upon urgent occasions,
some extraordinary aid to the king.&nbsp; Being generally, too,
more favourable to his power, their deputies seem, some times, to
have been employed by him as a counterbalance, in those
assemblies, to the authority of the great lords. <a
name="citation384"></a><a href="#footnote384"
class="citation">[384]</a>&nbsp; Hence, as it seems, the origin
of the representation of burghs in our parliaments.</p>
<p>However useless or objectionable our modern burghs or
corporate towns may be, it must be allowed that they were
originally productive of no inconsiderable national
advantages.&nbsp; In them, as has been observed by the writer
last mentioned, order and good government together with the
liberty and security of individuals, were established at a time
when the occupiers of land in the country were exposed to every
kind of violence.&nbsp; That industry also, which aims at
something more than necessary subsistence was found in them
before it was commonly practised, or did exit among the country
farmers.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;If in the hands of a poor cultivator,
oppressed with the servitude of villanage, some little <a
name="page385"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 385</span>stock
should accumulate, he would naturally conceal it, with great
care, from his master, to whom it would otherwise have belonged,
and take the first opportunity of running away to a town.&nbsp;
The law was, at that time, so indulgent to the inhabitants of
towns, and so desirous of diminishing the authority of the lords,
over those of the country, that if he could conceal himself
there, from the pursuit of the lord, for a year, he was free for
ever.&nbsp; Whatever stock therefore accumulated in the hands of
the industrious part of the inhabitants of the country, naturally
took refuge in cities, as the only sanctuaries in which it could
be secure to the person that acquired it.&rdquo; <a
name="citation385"></a><a href="#footnote385"
class="citation">[385]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus it appears the cities and towns were then replenished
with inhabitants from the industrious and most valuable part of
the population of the country, and not, as is too often the case
in our time, from the most idle, profligate, and worthless.</p>
<p>From what has been already said of the motive or policy that
seems to have given birth to our burgh-system, it might naturally
be expected that those princes, who lived upon the worst terms
with their barons, would be the most ready and active promoters
of it, and the most liberal in their grants of municipal
immunities.&nbsp; This, at least, appears to have been the case:
and we find our <i>king</i> <span class="smcap">John</span>, for
example, and we may add, his son, and successor, <span
class="smcap">Henry</span> III. were most munificent benefactors
to those towns; of which <a name="page386"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 386</span>Lynn, may be mentioned as one
notable instance.&nbsp; This town owes, to those two sovereigns,
its political redemption, or elevation to the rank of a corporate
town, or free borough.&nbsp; The era of its arriving at this
high, and proud distinction, was the 13th century; whereas it
was, before that period, the miserable abode of a horde of
slaves, the vassals of the lord bishops of the see in which it is
situated.</p>
<p>But though Lynn acquired then the rank and denomination of a
free burgh, it does not appear, that it also became possessed of
equal freedom from baronial domination, and feudal vassalage,
with all the rest of our corporate towns; or, that it actually
arrived at that state or degree of liberty, for a very long while
after, even till the reign of <i>Henry</i> VIII. about 300 years
after it had been first declared a free burgh by king <i>John</i>
and his successor.&nbsp; The time when it acquired the name of
<i>King&rsquo;s Lynn</i>, seems, therefore, to be the true era of
its actual, and entire liberation from its former feudal
encumbrances.&nbsp; Lynn then is a place where the memory of the
last Henry ought to be held dear, and where he should be
commemorated as one of its best benefactors.&nbsp; These,
however, are circumstances, not generally adverted to; but they
seem to be real matters of fact, and may deserve here some
elucidation.</p>
<p>King <i>John</i>, granting to Lynn its charter of
incorporation at the instance of bishop <i>Grey</i>, who had so
much interest with him, and to whom he had very great
obligations, was not likely to attempt to deprive him of <a
name="page387"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 387</span>his
baronial rights, or supreme power and jurisdiction, in this town:
nor do we know that the bishop was at all disposed to relinquish
the same.&nbsp; We accordingly find an express clause in the
royal charter, <i>saving to the said bishop and his
successors</i>, <i>the liberties</i>, <i>&amp;c. which had
previously belonged to the bishops of Norwich</i>.&nbsp; That
this was understood as securing to the bishops their former
rights and authority in this town, may be inferred from the
general conduct of the succeeding prelates for many generations,
who seem to have been uniformly striving to retain and perpetuate
the said rights and authority, and keep the inhabitants in their
original state of subjection to them.&nbsp; Nor did the mayor and
corporation appear, at all, disposed to the point with their
lordships, except in very few instances; as in the time of
bishops <i>Spencer</i>, <i>Wakeryng</i>, and <i>Nix</i>, already
noticed.&nbsp; There seems, also to have been some stir, of the
same sort, made in the time of bishop <i>Hart</i>, or
<i>Lyhart</i>, in the year 1446, and the corporation, probably,
complained, or appealed to the king, (Henry VI.) who then visited
this town, and seems to have favoured the cause of the
corporation; for he is said to have ordered the sword to be
carried before the mayor.&nbsp; But the bishop would not long
submit to this royal order, for the very next year he had the
sword carried before himself, as formerly, the mayor following,
as one of his retinue or municipal officers. <a
name="citation387"></a><a href="#footnote387"
class="citation">[387]</a></p>
<p>On the whole, therefore, it seems pretty evident that <a
name="page388"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 388</span>though Lynn
became a corporate town, and was declared a free burgh as early
as the beginning of the 13th century, yet it was not entirely
freed from the temporal jurisdiction of the bishop, and the hard
yoke of feudal domination, and so did not attain to equal liberty
and independence with the generality of our English boroughs till
a good part of the 16th century had elapsed.&nbsp; We accordingly
find that the mayor and corporation, in the mean time, or during
most part of it, seemed perfectly ready to approve as well as
profess themselves the lordly prelate&rsquo;s <i>humble tenants
and devout bedesmen</i>; giving him the most explicit and solemn
assurance, &ldquo;that he should find in them <i>as lowly tenants
as any that longed to him within his lordships</i>,&rdquo; and
that their <i>bodies</i> as well as <i>goods</i> were entirely at
his service, &amp;c. agreeably to the tenour of the above
memorable letter to bishop Wakeryng. <a name="citation388"></a><a
href="#footnote388" class="citation">[388]</a>&mdash;We may
therefore venture to affirm that this town was, at most, but
partially liberated from feudal vassalage, till the period above
specified; that is, within these 300 years; before which the
<i>mayors</i> of Lynn appeared, or might justly be considered, as
the bishops&rsquo; head-men, chief bailiffs, or slave drivers;
and the <i>aldermen</i> as so many underlings, or petty officers,
implicitly executing his lordship&rsquo;s paramount orders or
commands.&mdash;Though the Charters might sometimes be thought to
entitle his worship and his brethren to greater independence and
a higher character, yet till then it does not seem that they were
enabled to assume their proper dignity and consequence.&nbsp; <a
name="page389"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 389</span>The bishops
being so powerful here, took care always to manage so as to
thwart and baffle all their attempts.&nbsp; Nor did there seem to
be any prospect of their succeeding in obtaining their proper
station while the bishop continued to retain a paramount sway and
uncontrolled power in the town.&nbsp; This the king, probably
saw: and it might be one, if not the chief reason of his
requiring the bishops, <i>Nix</i> and <i>Rugg</i>, to relinquish
their oppressive jurisdiction here.&nbsp; However that might be,
it is certain that his majesty deserved well of this corporation:
and whatever their ideas or feelings may have been, or may now
be, on this point, it must be said, that they ought to consider
<i>Henry</i> among the very chief of their royal benefactors;
with whom such princes as <i>Charles</i> and <i>James</i> the
second, can, surely, bear no comparison; to whom, nevertheless,
<i>statues</i> have been here erected!! <a

<p class="gutsumm">Further observations on the history of Lynn
during the period under consideration&mdash;probable state of the
town, as to its internal police and municipal economy previously
to its being declared a free burgh and receiving its first royal
charter&mdash;changes resulting from that event&mdash;statement
of subsequent occurrences.</p>
<p>It has been already observed that Lynn was a place of
considerable trade, and of growing importance and opulence, at
and before the Conquest.&nbsp; Afterward its trade kept rapidly
increasing; and in the reign of <i>Richard</i> I. it was become a
place of distinguished eminence, insomuch that it was called by
William of Newburgh, who lived at that time, &ldquo;a noble city,
or a city of note for its trade and commerce.&rdquo; <a
name="citation390"></a><a href="#footnote390"
class="citation">[390]</a>&nbsp; Foreign merchants had then a
regular established connection and intercourse with this town,
and their ships and sailors frequented it in great numbers.&nbsp;
A considerable body of Jews also had settled here, and must have
been among the most active and useful part of its population;
which further corroborates the report of its being in those days
a place of no small commercial note and consequence, for those <a
name="page391"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 391</span>people were
not likely to settle, in any great numbers, except in places of
that description. <a name="citation391"></a><a
href="#footnote391" class="citation">[391]</a>&nbsp; Indeed it
seems pretty clear and certain that both in the reign of Richard
<a name="page392"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 392</span>and that
of his brother and successor John, Lynn ranked very high among
the trading towns of this kingdom, in point of commercial
importance: and it is recorded upon undoubted authority, that in
the sixth year of the last of those two reigns, (the date of our
first royal charter) the tax or tallage of the king at Lynn,
amounted to 651<i>l.</i> whereas that of London at the same time
amounted only to 836<i>l.</i> 12<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> <a
name="citation392"></a><a href="#footnote392"
class="citation">[392]</a>&nbsp; From which we may infer that the
revenue which the crown then derived from the trade of this town,
was more than two thirds of what it derived from that of London;
and consequently that the trade itself of this town did in the
mean time bear the same proportion to that of the metropolis;
which may be presumed to have been the case of very few places,
if any, besides in the kingdom.&mdash;Lynn being allowed to have
a mint, or mints for the coining of money, belonging to the king
and the bishop, <a name="citation393a"></a><a
href="#footnote393a" class="citation">[393a]</a> <a
name="page393"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 393</span>has been
deemed another proof of the flourishing state of the town at that
period.</p>
<p>Of the government of Lynn, or its municipal economy in those
times, very little is known, except that it appears to have been
under the management of an officer who bore the name of
<i>provost</i>, who doubtless was nominated by the bishop, and
acted as his bailiff or deputy; but whether he was elected
annually or held his office for a longer or shorter term, or
during the pleasure of his master, seems rather uncertain.&nbsp;
He was, however, the chief magistrate of the town, and had, of
course, other officers assisting and acting under him, like our
chief magistrates of more modern times.&nbsp; It is very provable
that the order of things in this town was not so materially
changed by <i>king</i> <span class="smcap">John</span> as some
may imagine.&nbsp; The chief alteration apparently was, that the
town now ranked among those incorporated by royal charter, was
consequently declared a free burgh, had its burgesses exempted
from tolls, &amp;c. in all parts of England, but London; and
finally, had its chief magistrate denominated <i>mayor</i>,
instead of <i>provost</i>, <a name="citation393b"></a><a
href="#footnote393b" class="citation">[393b]</a> a circumstance,
probably of no mighty consequence, or real benefit to the
community, though highly gratifying, perhaps, to the pride and
vanity of the corporation.&nbsp; The real difference, however,
between a <i>mayor</i> and a <i>provost</i>, seems <a
name="page394"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 394</span>to be very
little, if any thing, more than that between <i>Tweedledum</i>
and <i>Tweedledee</i>.&nbsp; The former indeed is generally taken
to be the highest and most honourable appellation, and therefore
our corporations naturally prefer it to the other, as the title
of their head man, or chief magistrate.&nbsp; After all, the
inferiority of the <i>provost</i> does not seem always
perceivable; and nobody, perhaps, would deem the <i>lord</i>
<span class="smcap">Mayor</span> <i>of York</i> as superior in
dignity to the <i>lord </i><span
class="smcap"><i>Provost</i></span><i> of Edinburgh</i>.</p>
<p>The smiles and favours of royalty are always gratifying to
most people: those of <i>king </i><span
class="smcap"><i>John</i></span> were so, no doubt, to his Lynn
subjects, and may be supposed to have confirmed them more than
ever in their attachment to him, which appears to have continued
strong and steady afterwards during the remainder of his
reign.&nbsp; Of the worth and merit of that attachment, his
majesty seemed duly sensible: as a proof of which, they received
from him in return, some very flattering and lasting tokens,
beside the immunities and privileges specified in his charters;
especially the silver <i>cup</i> which is still in being, and
shewn to strangers and others as a great curiosity.&nbsp; It is
an elegant double-gilt, embossed, and enamelled cup and cover,
weighing 73 ounces, and of exquisite workmanship, and shews the
uncommon skill and ingenuity of some our silver-smiths of that
period, who were probably of the monkish order, as our best
artists, as well as most renowned scholars, were then chiefly to
be found within the solemn precincts of our monasteries.</p>
<p>The <i>sword</i>, which is usually carried before our mayors,
<a name="page395"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 395</span>has been
also considered as another mark or token of king <span
class="smcap"><i>John&rsquo;s</i></span> favour to this town; but
this appears a very questionable matter.&nbsp; This weapon, which
has a silver mounting, the king is said to have taken from his
side, and given to the corporation, to be carried before the
major: but it does not appear that there was a sword at all
carried before our mayors as early as the reign of king John, or
even for a long time after.&nbsp; If such a ceremony was really
observed here before the reign of Henry V. or of Henry VI. it
must seemingly have been appropriated solely to the great lords
of the place, the bishops of Norwich, who appear, all along to
have claimed, that honour as their own peculiar, and exclusive
prerogative: the mayors having no share in it, but only as they
followed their masters, the bishops, and formed a part of their
retinue.&nbsp; Bishop Gibson, in his additions to Camden,
observes that the present sword, though said to have been given
by king John, was really the gift of Henry VIII. after the town
came into his possession, and he changed their <i>burgesses</i>
into aldermen.&nbsp; John&rsquo;s charter does not mention the
sword, but that granted by Henry expressly says, that he granted
them a sword to be carried before their mayor.&nbsp; As to the
inscription on the blade of the present sword, purporting its
being the gift of king John, it proves nothing, being apparently
the unauthorized contrivance of two forward fellows of the town,
a sword cutler and a school-master, as late as the reign of queen
Elizabeth. <a name="citation395"></a><a href="#footnote395"
class="citation">[395]</a>&nbsp; But, however improbable it may
be that the said <i>sword</i> was ever the property of king John,
and given by him as a present <a name="page396"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 396</span>and mark of his royal and special
favour to this corporation, yet there does not seem to be any
just reason for entertaining similar doubts respecting the
<i>cup</i> before-mentioned.&nbsp; The only circumstance relating
to the cup which one would be inclined to deem doubtful, or
rather incredible, is a certain sly insinuation, which has been
sometimes heard, that it was a part of a parcel of stolen goods,
which his majesty, while on a visit at Walsingham, contrived to
pilfer from that celebrated abbey, and coming afterward to Lynn,
made a present of it to the corporation.</p>
<p>Lynn seems to have paid very dearly for the said king&rsquo;s
favours.&nbsp; Camden, in his account of this town observes, that
it enjoys very large immunities, which its inhabitants
&ldquo;purchased of king John with the price of their own blood,
spent in the defence of his cause:&rdquo; alluding, probably, to
the powerful assistance they afforded him in reducing the
disaffected barons of this county, whose subjugation proved an
arduous undertaking, and whom he afterwards severely
chastised.&nbsp; The assistance they rendered to this sovereign
consisted not only in recruits for his army, or a strong and
resolute body of landsmen, but also in sailors and ships for his
naval operations: hence Lynn and Yarmouth are mentioned by Carte
among the principal places that furnished his majesty with a
<i>fleet</i> to oppose that of France on a certain occasion. <a
name="citation396"></a><a href="#footnote396"
class="citation">[396]</a>&nbsp; In short, the good people of
this town appear to have assisted that memorable monarch to the
utmost of their ability, or in all the ways, <a
name="page397"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 397</span>and by all
the means that were in their power.&nbsp; He, on the other hand,
is said to have been very partial to them, and deemed them so
trustworthy, and their town so secure a place, that he deposited
there, for some time his crown and regalia, and his most valuable
treasures; but took them away at his last visit, and lost them
all, soon after, in crossing the Wash, at an improper place, or
improper time; which he laid so to heart that it hastened his
death, which took place a very short time after at Newark.&nbsp;
There is indeed no small disagreement among our historians in
their accounts of king John after his last departure from
Lynn.&nbsp; Some represent him as crossing the <i>Wash</i>, or
rather the <i>Ouse</i>, then called <i>Wellstream</i>, at the
<i>Cross Keys</i>; others represent him as crossing it at
<i>Wisbeach</i>, and the latter seems to be the truth.&nbsp;
Some, again, ascribe the illness which terminated his life, to
<i>poison</i>, administered by a monk of Swineshead; others
ascribe it to <i>vexation</i> for the loss of his treasures;
while others assure us that it is to be ascribed to neither of
these causes, but that he was ill before that disaster of losing
his treasures befel him.&nbsp; Nay, some have alleged, or
suggested, that his last illness originated at Lynn, and was
occasioned by his intemperate living during his stay here.&nbsp;
In accounts different and contradictory, it is no easy task to
distinguish truth from fiction.&nbsp; It seems however to be
pretty well established that the said king left Lynn on the 11th
of October, 1216, was at Wisbeach on the 12th, at Sleaford on the
15th, and at Newark on the 18th, where he died the very next day:
but the story of the poison seems very doubtful and even
improbable; nor does that <a name="page398"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 398</span>concerning the loss of his crown and
treasures seem perfectly clear and indubitable. <a
name="citation398"></a><a href="#footnote398"
class="citation">[398]</a></p>
<p>Even the fact that Lynn had been the depository of the
king&rsquo;s treasures, with his crown and regalia, during his
absence from these parts, and till he removed them at his last
departure, becomes very doubtful, or rather quite improbable, if
we believe Rapin&rsquo;s assertion, from M. Paris, that the
king&rsquo;s great competitor, the Dauphin, not long before, and
within that same year, had actually reduced Lynn, and made the
whole county, as well as those of Suffolk and Essex tributary to
him.&nbsp; In that case, those treasures, &amp;c. if deposited
here, must inevitably have fallen into the Dauphin&rsquo;s hands,
and so be entirely lost to the king.&nbsp; We must therefore
either conclude that the alleged fact of Lynn having been the
depository of the said treasures, for any length of time, is
unfounded, or that the said assertion, that Lynn had been that
year taken by the Dauphin, is so.&nbsp; But as these matters are
not very interesting, we will now drop them, and also our account
of king John for the present.</p>
<p>After the death of John, and in the reign of his son and
successor, Henry III. the people of Lynn, at one time, seem to
have sided with the malcontents of that period, and so forfeited
their chartered rights: but their defection was of no long
duration; they returned to their duty with every appearance of
contrition, and soon gave full proof of the ardour, as well as
the unfeignedness <a name="page399"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
399</span>of their loyalty.&nbsp; Camden says that they
&ldquo;purchased their lost liberties of Henry III. not without
blood, when they sided with him against the outlawed barons, and
unluckily engaged them in the Isle of Ely.&nbsp; An account
whereof we have in the book of Ely, and in Matthew Paris.&rdquo;
<a name="citation399a"></a><a href="#footnote399a"
class="citation">[399a]</a>&nbsp; The battle here alluded to was
fought somewhere about Littleport, where the Lynn volunteers of
that day were very roughly handled by their opponents, and lost a
considerable number of their people; of which mention has been
made by several of our historians.&nbsp; In the 8th and 9th years
of that king&rsquo;s reign, licence was granted to foreign
merchants to come with safety to the fair of Lenn; and in the
11th year a talliage was granted to the king by the bishop.&nbsp;
The oath of the burghers then was, &ldquo;You shall faithfully
pay your talliage made by the lord (bp.) at his will, of all your
chattels&rsquo; of your own property, whatever they are, and of
the chattels of your wife, and all that is your due to
pay.&rdquo; <a name="citation399b"></a><a href="#footnote399b"
class="citation">[399b]</a>&nbsp; Thus payment was made upon
oath; but the tax was granted to the king by the bishop, without
the concurrence of the burghers; and also assessed and levied by
him <i>at his will</i>, without check or control.&nbsp; In such a
case, and under such circumstances, it might be reasonably
supposed there would be some misdoings, and not a few causes of
complaint, and that misunderstanding would arise between his
lordship and his Lynn vassals, which might lead to very serious
results.&nbsp; That it really did so happen appears from
authentic documents.</p>
<p><a name="page400"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
400</span>Sometime after the above taxation, the people or
burgesses of Lynn, dissatisfied, it seems, with the arbitrary and
oppressive proceeding of their lord, the bishop, in that
instance, and questioning his right to tax them at will, or
without their consent, took upon them to tax themselves without
consulting him, as well as to elect a mayor also without his
permission.&nbsp; This his lordship greatly resented, as
absolutely illegal and highly criminal: and he also, very sorely
felt it, no doubt, as deeply affecting his own baronial claims
here, or endangering his feudal dominion.&nbsp; He accordingly
proceeded against them in the ecclesiastical court, and had them
all excommunicated.&nbsp; In that grievous dilemma, and from so
arbitrary and galling a sentence, they appealed to the
king&rsquo;s justices at Westminster, before whom the affair
underwent a legal investigation: of which, and its result, the
following account is given by Parkin.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In the 8th. of this king (Henry III.) a
fine was levied, at Westminster in Trinity term, before Robert
Lexington, William de York, Ralph de Norwich, William de Lisle,
Adam Fitz-William, and Ralph de Rokele, the king&rsquo;s
justices, between the mayor and burgesses, querents, and Thomas
Blundevile, bishop of Norwich, deforcient.&nbsp; The Mayor
&amp;c. complained, that the bishop had impleaded them in a court
christian (ecclesiastical or spiritual court) and had
excommunicated them, because they had created a mayor among
themselves, and had taxed and talliaged themselves, in the said
burgh without his assent; and it was agreed between them in the
said court, that the bishop should <a name="page401"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 401</span>grant for himself and successors,
and his church of Norwich, that the said burgesses, for the
future, may chuse and create to themselves a mayor, whomsoever
they pleased of their own body, on this condition, That
immediately after his election, or creation, they should present
him to the bishop and his successors, wherever they should be in
the diocese of Norwich; who on the presentation should be
admitted by the bishop without any contradiction: and for this
fine and concord, the mayor and burgesses grant for themselves,
their heirs and successors, that whosoever shall be so created
and elected mayor by them, shall promise on his good faith and
fealty, by which he is engaged to the bishop, and his successors,
that he will observe all things that belong to his office, as
long as he shall continue therein, and preserve, as much as is in
his power, the liberties of the church of Norwich.&nbsp; This
agreement and fine was made in the presence of the king, who
consented to it.&nbsp; This king, as appears from many instances,
sate frequently in the court of king&rsquo;s bench at the head of
his justices.&rdquo; <a name="citation401"></a><a
href="#footnote401" class="citation">[401]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It does not appear from the above account how the taxation or
assessment business was then settled; but it seems most probable
that it was taken out of the hands both of the bishop and the
burgesses, and committed to the management of certain officers
appointed by the crown.&nbsp; It is likely indeed that that point
had been previously settled, and that the names of the first
officers, <a name="page402"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
402</span>or assessors, are still preserved: for we are told that
&ldquo;in the 17th. of the said reign, (which was the year
preceding that of the above trial) Thomas de Milton, and Warin,
son of Imbert, were named by the king, to assess the talliage,
and all the demeans of the see of Norwich.&rdquo; <a
name="citation402"></a><a href="#footnote402"
class="citation">[402]</a>&nbsp; This point therefore might not
come under discussion in the above trial at Westminster.&nbsp;
But the case of creating, or choosing a mayor, seems to have been
there very carefully investigated.&nbsp; The result was (as above
stated) that the right of the burgesses, to elect a mayor from
among themselves, was fully established; on the express
condition, however, that, immediately after his election they
should present him to the bishop, wherever he should be within
the diocese; who on his part was to receive him without any
refusal, disapproval, or, contradiction.</p>
<p>From the preceding statement one would be apt to conclude,
that the right of the burgesses to choose a mayor, independently
of the bishop&rsquo;s will and pleasure, was now fully settled
and that his lordship would no longer presume to interfere,
either directly or indirectly, on that occasion.&nbsp; But it
cannot be affirmed that the event warrants that conclusion.&nbsp;
The lust of power is a strong passion, and not very soon or
easily subdued.&nbsp; The bishops having so long borne
uncontrolled sway in the direction and management of every thing
in this town, it was not to be expected that they would be very
ready to resign or relinquish it.&nbsp; The mayors here from the
first, it seems, were called <i>The bishop&rsquo;s men</i>, <a
name="page403"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 403</span>and their
lordships appeared always desirous to perpetuate the appellation,
or, at least, to do all in their power to prevent its becoming
inapplicable.&nbsp; Though the words of charters, the opinions of
judges, and even the declarations of kings, might appear against
them, yet they were scarcely ever at a loss for ways and means to
surmount or evade all such difficulties, and secure their own
beloved power and preponderance.&nbsp; So the case seems to have
been at Lynn for a very long period.&nbsp; Neither the provision
of charters, the verdict of judges, nor the orders of princes,
could effect any material or lasting diminution of the exorbitant
power of the bishop over this town, till the 16th century.&nbsp;
It appeared like an inveterate evil, or incurable malady, until
it felt the royal touch of Henry VIII. when it gave way at once,
and underwent a radical and perfect cure.</p>
<p>As to the above agreement between the contending parties at
Westminster, it does not appear that the bishops thought proper
long, if at all, to act in compliance with it, and so refrain
from any further interference in the election of appointment of a
chief magistrate.&nbsp; This must have sat uneasy on the minds of
the corporation, and they would naturally, and perhaps repeatedly
complain to their sovereign against so oppressive an infringement
of their municipal rights.&nbsp; Even the king himself also would
feel it as an insult offered to him, as he was personally present
when the agreement was made, and had sanctioned it by his own
express approbation.&nbsp; On this ground we may account for that
clause in the charter which he granted to our burgesses in the
52nd <a name="page404"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
404</span>year of his reign, in which he not only confirms their
former liberties, but also allows them to choose a mayor of
themselves, <i>without presenting him to the bishop</i>.&nbsp;
This last exemption from a former obligation and customary
observance, seems plainly to indicate that the bishop had taken
some such undue advantage of his power and influence as was
before suggested; of which his majesty now thought proper to
signify his entire disapprobation, by discharging the burghers
from every obligation to pay his lordship any further regard, in
their future choice or appointment of a chief magistrate.&nbsp;
This the bishop must have felt somewhat mortifying.&nbsp; But as
his feudal jurisdiction here still continued unabolished, it was
not likely he would be long at a loss to find means to evade the
force or operation of that humiliating clause, and secure or
reestablish his wonted preeminence.&nbsp; That it actually did so
happen, appears but too evident by all that we know of the
subsequent history of the town.&nbsp; Every attempt to reduce the
bishop&rsquo;s predominance here, during the period of which we
are now treating, proved unsuccessful.&nbsp; The burgesses never
could effectually shake off his yoke, or cease to be his vassals
and subjects; and even their elections of mayors, in general, if
not always, might be compared to the modern conge d&rsquo;elire
elections of bishops, by our Deans and Chapters.</p>
<p>During the long reign of which we have been speaking, this
kingdom suffered extremely from civil discord and intestine
commotions, and the inhabitants of Lynn bore their share in those
sufferings.&nbsp; Great numbers of <a name="page405"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 405</span>their people perished in a bloody
and unfortunate engagement against the barons, up in the country
somewhere towards Littleport, as has been before noticed; which
must have proved a most distressing calamity to the whole town,
and especially to the wives and children and other relatives of
the vanquished and slaughtered warriors.&nbsp; The enemy, being
so strong and formidable in and about the Isle of Ely, must also
have cut off all communication between Lynn and that district,
and even interrupted its intercourse with all the interior parts
of the country, as he had the entire command of the rivers and
channels of internal navigation.&nbsp; This seems to have
continued a long while, and must have distressed this town in a
very great degree.&nbsp; It appears, however, to have been quite
over, and tranquillity fully restored in the 41st year of that
reign, as we find the mayor and burgesses were that year
commanded by the king to permit the men of Ely to come here to
sell their beer, and exercise merchandise, as they had been used
to do before the disturbance. <a name="citation405a"></a><a
href="#footnote405a" class="citation">[405a]</a>&nbsp; In the
50th year the same reign, as we are further informed, the
king&rsquo;s purveyors bought at Lynn 36 tuns of wine, which the
sheriff of Norfolk was ordered to have conveyed to his majesty,
then at the siege of Kenilworth, or Kennelworth Castle, in
Warwickshire. <a name="citation405b"></a><a href="#footnote405b"
class="citation">[405b]</a>&nbsp; This also shews that there were
then no <a name="page406"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
406</span>very serious or dangerous commotions in the parts about
the Fens, and westward of Lynn, otherwise it would have been out
of the sheriff&rsquo;s power to have the said wine conveyed
across that country, and to his majesty&rsquo;s camp before
Kennelworth.&nbsp; It however alleged by our historians that the
malecontents who seized upon the Isle of Ely were the last that
held out, and that they did not surrender till after the
reduction of Kennelworth Castle.&nbsp; However that was, it is
allowed that the rebellion was now soon quelled, and that the
country afterwards enjoyed peace and tranquillity, for a long
period.</p>
<p>It was in this king&rsquo;s reign, as was before observed,
that the Ouse and other rivers deserted their ancient and natural
course by Wisbeach, and after inundating the fen country to a
very great extent, from the effect of which it has never yet
recovered, forced their passage into the sea by Lynn.&nbsp; A
neglecting of the old outfall, which occasioned the choking up of
the channel and impeding the course of the waters, in the time of
a great flood, has been assigned as the cause of that memorable
event.&nbsp; But as the malcontents had for sometime occupied the
fens, and made their last stand there, and as the inundation
might conduce materially to their defence, it seems very natural
to suspect that they also had some hand in the business.&nbsp;
Yet as our historians are silent on <a name="page407"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 407</span>this head, we cannot affirm it as a
matter of fact.&nbsp; The event proved, no doubt, detrimental to
Wisbeach; and yet not materially advantageous, at least, not
immediately so, to Lynn.&nbsp; Nor does it appear that even our
harbour was at all improved by so large an accession of fresh
water: on the contrary, for aught we know, the approach from the
sea to this town was quite as good before as it has been
since.&nbsp; It may be said however to be an event that somewhat
contributes to preserve the memory of the third Henry, among the
people of these parts.&nbsp; The character of this monarch is
well known, and is no way worthy of respect or imitation.&nbsp;
He was great in nothing but the vileness of his government and
the length of his reign, which extended to the 57th year: the
longest of any English reign, for the last ten centuries.&nbsp;
For the evils of which, and of all the bad and unfortunate reigns
that have occurred ever since that period, many, it is supposed,
will deem the blessed prosperity of the present wise and happy
reign as more than a sufficient counterbalance and
compensation&mdash;especially, if it should also last as long, or
still longer than that of Henry III. which seems not at all
improbable: and who is it, within this favoured country, but does
consider this as a consummation most devoutly to be wished?</p>

408</span>CHAP. V.</h3>
<p class="gutsumm">State of society at Lynn during the period
under consideration&mdash;the subject may be elucidated from
documents relative to our ancient Gilds&mdash;observations on the
nature of those fraternities&mdash;very common in this country
before the reformation&mdash;names and number of those of
Lynn.</p>
<p>It is sad enough to think, that during so long an interval as
that between the conquest and the reformation, the good people of
Lynn should never be able entirely to emancipate themselves from
their feudal vassalage.&nbsp; But as that desirable object always
proved to them unattainable, they appear to have submitted to
their hard fate with exemplary patience and forbearance; well
knowing, it seems, to use the words of the old adage, that what
cannot be cured must be endured.&nbsp; It is much to be doubted
if their descendants, or rather their successors of the present
day, would have endured what they did with equal propriety and
long suffering.&nbsp; We are indeed but imperfectly acquainted
with the social complexion, or characteristic features of the
community here in those times; but from what we do know, there is
reason to think favourably of the prevailing disposition of the
inhabitants.&nbsp; Except in the shocking affair <a
name="page409"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 409</span>of the poor
Jews, and what happened in the time of bishop Spencer and of
bishop Wakeryng, and of the two aldermen Wentworth and Petipas,
already noticed, we perceive no vestige here of tumultuous
risings or factious combinations.&nbsp; Industry and harmony
appear generally to have prevailed at Lynn, and the community
seldom failed in the duty of submission to their superiors, or of
obeying the higher powers.</p>
<p>On the state of society in this town, during the period now
under consideration, nothing perhaps throws so much light as
certain existing documents relating to out ancient Gilds, which
seem to have been more numerous here than any where else in the
kingdom.&nbsp; They were friendly associations formed for the
mutual benefit of their respective members.&nbsp; Some of them
were large trading companies, holding considerable possessions,
in houses, lands, and mercantile property.&nbsp; Others were of a
humbler sort, suited to the convenience and wants of those who
moved in a lower sphere, and constructed on principles, perhaps,
somewhat similar to those of our modern purse clubs, or benefit
societies.&nbsp; All were calculated to help the individuals who
composed them, to pass through life more comfortably, obtain a
more easy and plentiful subsistence, cherish love and goodwill
within their respective circles, and promote the peace and
welfare of the town or community in general.</p>
<p>The Gilds, certainly, form a most prominent feature in the
character of the ancient inhabitants of Lynn.&nbsp; They were
indeed very common in this country before <a
name="page410"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 410</span>the
reformation, and during the period we are now considering; but
were more numerous in this town than anywhere else we know of,
which is a very remarkable and, perhaps, unaccountable
circumstance.&nbsp; It seems very honourable to the memory of our
forefathers&mdash;more so, probably, than any thing else we can
mention; and therefore we shall dwell upon the subject with the
greater pleasure.&nbsp; It shews that there was then among the
inhabitants a prevailing or general disposition to assist one
another, and to give to every honest individual an opportunity to
place himself in such a situation as would not fail of bettering
his condition, and procuring him useful friends and reputable
associates.</p>
<p>These useful institutions, in most other places, only amounted
to one or two, or a few, by which only a small part of the
population could be very materially benefited by them.&nbsp; But
here they were formed on a large scale, and multiplied to
<i>above thirty</i>; some of them varying pretty much from
others, to suit, as we may suppose, the different conditions of
the inhabitants, all, or most of whom might consequently
accommodate themselves, or easily find a fraternity whose
constitution exactly corresponded, with their respective
capacities, wants, or wishes.&mdash;Our Gilds had all of them a
strong tincture of religion, or rather of superstition, according
to the prevailing fashion of the times.&nbsp; In that view they
exhibited, no doubt, a large portion of weakness, ignorance, and
absurdity.&nbsp; But they appear to have been very free from that
jealousy, bigotry, and ill will towards each other, which too
often disgrace the religious <a name="page411"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 411</span>fraternities of the present day, who
look upon one another with such an evil eye, that they may be too
justly said to hate one another.&nbsp; Trusting in themselves
that they are righteous, they despise others, and are ready to
say to their neighbours, and all who differ from them, stand by
yourselves, come not near to us, for we are holier than
you.&nbsp; While they inveigh against Pharisees, and a
pharisaical spirit, they give impartial and intelligent
bystanders every reason to think, that they are themselves, in
fact, the Pharisees of the present day, and are led by the very
spirit against which they declaim.&nbsp; But we will drop this
subject for the present, and resume that of the Gilds, which we
shall here handle under different heads, or sections.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Section</span> I.</h4>
<p class="gutsumm"><i>Observations on the origin of our ancient
Gilds</i>. <a name="citation411"></a><a href="#footnote411"
class="citation">[411]</a></p>
<p>The author of a late publication, entitled <i>Caledonia</i>,
gives it as his opinion, that the monks were the earliest Gild
brethren, and had exclusive privileges of trade and of fishery
when boroughs had scarcely an existence.&nbsp; To which the
annual reviewer of that work objects, and affirms that the origin
of Gilds lies hidden in obscurity inaccessible: and against the
idea of their being <a name="page412"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 412</span>of monkish origin, he urges, their
being constructed so much on the principles of a purse club, that
they can hardly not have been founded by married men. <a
name="citation412"></a><a href="#footnote412"
class="citation">[412]</a>&nbsp; The truth seems to be, that they
originated among the Anglo-Saxons, long before the Conquest, if
not also before their conversion to Christianity, and the
commencement of English monkery.&nbsp; At first, they may be
supposed to assume a simple and homely appearance, among the
civil institutions of the Anglo-Saxon community; but afterwards
to pass through different changes, and especially after the
conquest, when the general state of society and the whole order
of things experienced so considerable a revolution.&nbsp; They
were then, at first, perhaps, put down or laid aside, and
afterwards revived and resumed: at least, we hear little or
nothing of them under the first Norman kings, or till about the
13th century.</p>
<p>The most common and prevailing opinion seems to be, that the
gilds sprung from the Anglo-Saxons <i>tithings</i>: though it
may, perhaps, be questioned, if the tithings themselves did not
take their rise from them.&nbsp; Jacob, from Camden, informs
us,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;that the origin of gilds and fraternities
is said to be from the Saxon law, by which neighbours entered
into an association, and became bound for each other, to bring
forth him who committed any crime, or make satisfaction to the
party injured; for which purpose they raised a sum of money among
themselves, and put it into a common stock, whereout a pecuniary
compensation was made according to the <a
name="page413"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 413</span>quality of
the offence committed.&nbsp; From hence came our fraternities and
gilds: and they were in use in this kingdom long before any
formal licences were granted for them: though at this day [that
is, in Camden&rsquo;s time] they are a company combined together,
with orders and laws made by themselves, by the prince&rsquo;s
licence.&rdquo; <a name="citation413a"></a><a
href="#footnote413a" class="citation">[413a]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Chambers, in his Cyclop&aelig;dia, expresses himself much to
the same purpose.&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The original of Gilds, says he, is thus
related: it being a law among the Saxons, that every freeman <a
name="citation413b"></a><a href="#footnote413b"
class="citation">[413b]</a> of fourteen years old should find
sureties to keep the peace, or be committed to prison; certain
neighbours [therefore] entered into an association, [consisting
of ten families,] and became bound for each other, either to
produce him who committed an offence, or to make satisfaction to
the injured party.&nbsp; That they might the better do this, they
raised a sum of money among themselves, which they put into a
common stock; and when one of their pledges had committed an
offence, and was fled, then the other nine made satisfaction out
of this stock, by payment of money according to the
offence.&nbsp; Because this association consisted of ten
families, it was called a <i>decennary</i>: hence came our
fraternities.&nbsp; In observance of the above law, or custom, as
the same writer informs us, the sheriffs at every county court
did from time to time take the oaths of young persons, as they
arrived at the age of fourteen, and see that they belonged to one
<i>decennary</i> or another.&rdquo; <a name="citation413c"></a><a
href="#footnote413c" class="citation">[413c]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such is the account <a name="page414"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 414</span>given by these writers of the
ancient decennaries or tythings, from which the gilds are
supposed to have sprung; but it seems uncertain, after all,
whether the gilds sprung from the decennaries, or the decennaries
from them, or which of the two is the most ancient.&nbsp; They
might be co&euml;val, and grow up together: and the gilds having
survived the decennaries might occasion their being supposed to
have sprung from them.</p>
<p>Turner, the ingenious historian of the Anglo-Saxons, seems
also to ascribe to them the origination of Gilds: and he
observes, that the gilds, or social confederations, in which many
of those people chose to arrange themselves, deserve very
particular attention.&nbsp; Among other things, he says, that
their gilds are sometimes alluded to in the laws.&nbsp; If a man
without paternal relations should fight and kill another, then
his maternal kinsmen were ordered to pay one third of the Were,
his gild a third, and for the other part his gild was to
escape.&nbsp; In London there appears to have been free
gilds.&nbsp; In a charter of Canterbury, the three companies of
the Citizens within the walls, and those without, are
mentioned.&nbsp; Domesday also mentions a Gild of the Clergy in
that city.&nbsp; In short, Gilds appear to have been very common,
and in great request among the Anglo-Saxons.&nbsp; They seem on
the whole, as our author thinks, to be friendly associations,
made for mutual aid and contribution, to meet the pecuniary
exigencies which were perpetually arising, from burials, legal
exactions, penal mulcts, and other payments, or
compensations.&nbsp; That much good fellowship was connected with
them, cannot <a name="page415"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
415</span>be doubted.&nbsp; The fines of their own imposition
imply that the materials of conviviality were not
forgotten.&nbsp; In short, he thinks they may be called the
Anglo-Saxon clubs.&mdash;Even the more uncommon species of those
confederations, called <i>Gilda Mercatoria</i>, <i>or
Merchant&rsquo;s Gild</i>, seems to have existed among the same
people.&nbsp; That in mercantile and Seaports, says the same
author, there were also gilds and fraternities of men constituted
for the purpose of carrying on more successful enterprizes in
commerce, even in the Anglo-Saxon times, appears to be a
fact.&nbsp; Domesday, (he adds,) mentions the Gihalla, or
Guildhall of the burghers of Dover. <a name="citation415"></a><a
href="#footnote415" class="citation">[415]</a></p>
<p>The Gilds of Lynn, however, cannot be traced to so remote a
period as that of the Anglo-Saxons.&nbsp; There may, indeed, have
been gilds here at that period, and the fact can hardly be
doubted, as they were then so much in vogue, but we have no
traces of them now remaining.&nbsp; All the Lynn Gilds, whose
names and remains have reached our time, seem to have sprung up
long after the conquest.&nbsp; Of them we shall treat in the
ensuing pages.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Section</span> II.</h4>
<p class="gutsumm"><i>Names and Number of our ancient Gilds</i>;
<i>with some additional observations</i>.</p>
<p>Of the Lynn Gilds our printed books give but a very imperfect
and wretched account.&nbsp; Their list of names is extremely
defective, and the idea which they give of <a
name="page416"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 416</span>those
institutions is equally so.&nbsp; For a more correct and ample
information on this subject we are chiefly indebted to Mr.
King&rsquo;s MS. volume, before mentioned, which was compiled
about a hundred years ago, by some unknown hand, or hands, from
certain ancient and authentic documents, which seem no longer to
exist.&nbsp; Both Mackerell and Parkin appear to have seen this
volume, but they have not availed themselves of it to the extent
they might have done.&nbsp; Even its most curious and interesting
parts they have left unnoticed.&nbsp; In the latter part of this
volume is inserted the following &ldquo;Catalogue of the Gildes
in the Towne of Lynn&rdquo;&mdash;amounting in all to thirty
one.&nbsp; They stand in the following order: 1.&nbsp; The Gild
of <i>St. George</i>.&nbsp; 2. The Gild of <i>St.
Erasmus</i>.&nbsp; 3. The Gild of <i>St. John Baptist</i>.&nbsp;
4. The Gild of <i>St. Gyles and St. Julian</i>.&nbsp; 5. The Gild
of <i>St. Ethelerede</i>.&nbsp; 6. The Gild of <i>St.
Margarett</i>.&nbsp; 7. The Gild of <i>St. Anne</i>.&nbsp; The
Gild of the 12 <i>Apostles</i>.&nbsp; 9. The Gild of <i>St.
Christopher</i>.&nbsp; 10. The Gild of <i>our Lady</i>.&nbsp; 11.
The Gild of <i>St. Micheal the Archangel</i>.&nbsp; 12. The Gild
of <i>St. Nicholas</i>.&nbsp; 13. The Gild of <i>St.
Awdreys</i>.&nbsp; 14. The Gild of <i>St. Michael and King

The Gild of <i>St. Antony</i>.&nbsp; 27. The Gild of <i>St.

The Gild <a name="page417"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

Gild</i>.&nbsp; 31. The Gild of <i>St. William</i>, trading to
North Bern.</p>
<p>Such a large number of these fraternities, in such a place as
Lynn, and at such a period, must appear not a little
extraordinary, and what seems very difficult, if not impossible,
to account for, but on the supposition, that there existed here,
in the mean time, a very respectable degree of public and social
virtue, or in other words a prevailing disposition among the
inhabitants to promote each other&rsquo;s interest and
happiness.&nbsp; Upon that idea they must be thought very highly
as nothing could well be more creditable or honourable to their
memory.&nbsp; A tribute of respect, which seems to be so fairly
and justly their due, ought not to be here withheld from
them.&mdash;Nor should it here pass unnoticed, that Lynn is still
distinguished for a respectable number of similar institutions;
that is to say, for its purse-clubs, or benefit societies, the
gilds of the 18th and 19th centuries.&nbsp; Their number is about
<i>twenty</i>; and their members, altogether, may amount to 700,
or more; but, as most of them have families, the benefit or
advantage of these useful associations may be supposed to extend,
perhaps, to more than three times that number.&nbsp; Of the real
and important utility of these social institutions no doubt can
be entertained.&nbsp; The fact is universally admitted.&nbsp;
They are certainly beneficial, not only to the individuals more
immediately concerned, but even to the community at large, by
keeping a great many honest and industrious people from becoming
burdensome <a name="page418"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
418</span>to the parishes to which they belong.&mdash;It ought
also to be remarked that the benefits resulting from these
estimable institutions are to be attributed neither to the wisdom
of government, nor yet to the fostering care of the corporation,
but merely to the very commendable thoughtfulness and virtue of
the individuals that compose them.&nbsp; But here is not the
place to enlarge upon this topic: we shall therefore drop it for
this time, and resume the former subject.</p>
<p>Of these thirty one Gilds, above named, several seem to have
been of the higher order of those associations, or of the
mercantile sort, consisting of trading or commercial adventurers,
who enjoyed certain privileges by grants from the crown.&nbsp;
This appears to have been the case with the 1st the 4th, the 19th
the 20th, and 31st in the above catalogue; that is, the Gild of
<i>St. George</i>, that of <i>St. Gyles</i> and <i>St.
Julian</i>, that of <i>Corpus Christi</i>, that of the
<i>Trinity</i>, and that of <i>St. William</i>, trading to north
Bern.&nbsp; There might probably be some few more of the same
description.&nbsp; All the rest, it is supposed, were friendly
associations, formed for the benefit of the lower orders of
freemen, that is, of those who were not in a state of villanage,
for none of the latter appear to have been admitted into those
fraternities.&nbsp; Poor creatures! they were debarred from all
such advantages and comforts!&nbsp; In further considering the
Lynn gilds, we shall take them in the order in which they stand
in the catalogue, though it does not seem to be the most regular
and natural order, that of seniority.</p>

<p class="gutsumm"><i>A more particular account of some of the
Lynn Gilds</i>.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; St. <i>George&rsquo;s Gild</i>.&nbsp; Of this
fraternity the following account is given by Parkin&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Henry IV. by his letters patent, gave and
granted licence to John Brandon, Bartholomew Sistern, and John
Snailwell of Lenne Epispopi, that they might make, found, and
establish to the honor of God, and the glorious martyr, St.
George a certain fraternity, brotherhood, and perpetual Guild of
themselves and others, who out of their devotion, were willing to
be of the said fraternity: and that brothers and sisters of the
fraternity and guild for the time being might chuse, make, and
ordain one alderman, and four custodes of the said fraternity and
guild, yearly, for the good and profit of the same, and out of
the brethren of the said fraternity and guild: and that the said
alderman and custodes and their successors, by the names of the
alderman and custodes of the said guild, should have power, and
be able to take, receive, and hold, any lands, tenements, rents,
and possessions whatsoever, or should be by any ways or means
granted to them, and to do in all other respects, &amp;c. and to
act as the rest of his liege subjects, or persons do, and have
power, and are enabled to act.&mdash;And further the said king,
out of his abundant grace, granted and gave licence, by his said,
letters parent, for himself and his heirs, to the aforesaid
alderman and custodes and their successors, for the time being,
that they might receive and hold to themselves and their
successors for ever, and purchase of J. March the right that
Richard Waterden <a name="page420"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
420</span>had therein of all that tenement, with a kay adjoining,
with all its buildings and appertenances in Lenn aforesaid, which
belonged to Robert Baylly, which tenement is in the street called
Cheker, between the tenement formerly of John de Couteshale and
the heirs of the late William Bytering, now of William
Hundredpound, and the heirs of the late John Wyntworth, on the
south part, the tenement formerly of Nicholas Swerdeston, late of
John Wyghton, wherein Walter Tudenham now dwells, and extends
itself in length from the common way towards the west to the
tenement formerly of Dominick Baude, afterwards of Richard Denne,
lately of John Grene, clerk, then of Thomas Botekesham to the
east.&nbsp; And the aforesaid kay lies opposite to the said
tenement, in breadth, between the kay formerly of the aforesaid
John Couteshale, lately of the aforesaid John Wyntworth, to the
south, and the common lane, (venellam) called cornlane, on the
north, and extends itself from the common way to the east, to the
great bank (ripam) of Lenne, to the west, as well as for the
maintenance of one or two chaplains, as to pray for the good
estate of the king and his most beloved consort Joan, queen of
England, as long as they lived, and for their souls after their
deaths, and for the souls of their most beloved father and
mother, deceased, as also for the good state of all and singular
the brothers and sisters of the fraternity and guild aforesaid,
according to the will and ordinance of the aforesaid alderman,
the custodes, and their successors.&rdquo; <a
name="citation420"></a><a href="#footnote420"
class="citation">[420]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page421"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 421</span>This
Gild, it is said, received many other grants of lands and
tenements from Henry V. which probably might also be the case
from some of the succeeding princes.&nbsp; But at the reformation
it was dissolved, as were also the rest, at least those that were
of a trading nature: <a name="citation421a"></a><a
href="#footnote421a" class="citation">[421a]</a> all whose
possessions, it is supposed, were given to the corporation by
Edward VI.&mdash;The premises here described were in Checker
Street, and comprehended the Gild Hall of the fraternity, called
St. George&rsquo;s Hall, now the Play-house. <a
name="citation421b"></a><a href="#footnote421b"
class="citation">[421b]</a></p>
<p>From the above extract the reader may form some idea of our
ancient gild of St. George.&nbsp; But in order to have a more
accurate and perfect conception of it, and of the others, all the
following accounts must be compared together.&nbsp; Of most of
our gilds we have only the names.&nbsp; Of others some further
information is still obtainable, of which the author will
endeavour in these pages to make the best use he can.&nbsp; It
may be here just observed, that the gilds of the higher order
appear to have their respective <i>altars</i> in the different
churches of the town, which shews how much religion was blended
with those institutions, and what a high character for sanctity
the members assumed.&nbsp; They had also their respective <a
name="page422"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
422</span><i>chaplains</i>, to act as their proper religious
functionaries, and pray for the souls of their members and
benefactors, dead as well as living.</p>
<p>Of the second and third gild in the above catalogue, that is,
those of <i>St. Erasmus</i> and of <i>St. John Baptist</i>, we
have been able to obtain no further information.&nbsp; They were
probably of the lower description of these fraternities, and
having no large possessions attached to them, they left behind
scarcely any trace or memorial of their existence.&nbsp; They
might, for all that, be very respectable in their day, and their
members be as useful and worthy members of the community as those
who composed the great trading or mercantile gilds.</p>
<p>Of the fourth gild in the catalogue, that of <i>St. Gyles</i>
and <i>St. Julian</i>, we know more than of the two last
mentioned.&nbsp; This, in its day, must have been a notable
gild.&nbsp; It was founded in the 14th century, and in the reign
of Richard II. as appears from the following very curious
document, preserved in Mr. King&rsquo;s book, and which is here
given in the original orthography&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In the honour of our Lord Jesus Christ, and

<p>From some notes, in the same volume, immediately following the
above long extract, it appears that there was an <i>Almshouse</i>
connected with the said Gild, or under its patronage, from the
first: Also that there was a <i>charity company</i>, dwelling in
a <i>Bede house</i> adjoining to that same Almshouse; which
likewise became afterwards connected with the said gild.&nbsp;
The Bedehouse <a name="page429"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
429</span>was, probably, the present women&rsquo;s Hospital,
still sometimes called <i>the Bedehouse</i>; and the Almshouse
might stand where Mr. Bonnett&rsquo;s dwelling and school now
do.&nbsp; From the same notes it also seems, that the date of the
foundation of the said Gild, as given above, must be wrong, owing
perhaps to the carelessness of the transcriber, and that it had
been founded earlier.&mdash;The notes alluded to are the
following; which are here inserted, that the intelligent reader
may have an opportunity to judge for himself.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;1476.&nbsp; This day comond <a

</blockquote>
<p>From these Extracts it is very evident that the above <a
name="page437"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 437</span>fraternity
of St. Gyles and St. Julian must have stood high among our
ancient Gilds.&nbsp; It consisted, it seems, of divers opulent
members, who did honour to their feelings by the attention which
they paid to the wants and sufferings of their indigent
neighbours of both sexes: for we find that there were two
Almeshouses, one for poor <i>men</i>, and another for poor
<i>women</i>, under their patronage, and supported by them, if
not also founded by them.&nbsp; On this account we ought to
respect their memory, papists as they were; for this part of
their conduct was, surely, very commendable and exemplary.&nbsp;
Such a conduct is worthy of respect and commendation wherever it
is seen: among papists as well as protestants; and even among
mahometans or heathens as well as christians.&nbsp; There are
Almeshouses still at Lynn, but we know not that they owe much, if
any thing, to the bounty or liberality of any of our present
opulent families, or to any of their immediate, or even remote
progenitors.&nbsp; They were endowed by wealthy families or
individuals of other times, whose descendants have long
disappeared.&nbsp; Our modern men of wealth are otherwise
disposed: and our Allens, our Bagges, our Bowkers, and our Cases,
have lived and died without exhibiting any symptoms of feelings
like those that appeared in the charitable fraternity of St.
Gyles and St. Julian.&nbsp; If the latter were also in other
matters weak and superstitious, that was perhaps unavoidable by
people in their circumstances.&nbsp; We have our weaknesses and
superstitions too, and those, probably, much less excusable, <a
name="page438"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 438</span>considering
our superior advantages, than those of the brethren and sisters
of the said Gild.&nbsp; Instead, therefore, of decrying, or
pitying their failings, we ought to blush for our own.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is observable of the above brotherhood, that
they consisted of <i>good men and able</i>, <i>and of good
conversation</i>. (see p. 423.)&nbsp; So careful were they on
this head, that every member at his admission was obliged to find
<i>two sureties</i>, who were to answer for the due performance
of his engagement to the gild, and also to testify of his <i>good
beryng and honest</i>, or that he was a person of irreproachable
moral character. (see p. 426.)&nbsp; We are not certain that our
modern <i>protestant</i> Gilds, the benefit societies, &amp;c.
are equally careful that those whom they receive among them be
persons of good report, or blameless conversation.&nbsp; It would
certainly be very creditable to them.&mdash;The said gild also
appeared anxious to support a respectable religious character,
and promote, what they deemed, the practice of piety among
themselves: hence they had their proper chaplain or religious
functionary, as was before noticed.&nbsp; Indeed they seemed as
if desirous to be thought to excel in this department, as is
pretty plainly indicated, by their assuming the name of the
<i>Lenn holy company</i>, which may be thought to smell a little
pharisaical.&nbsp; However that was, as they possessed so many
good qualities, and deserved well of their neighbours and fellow
citizens, we can do no less than dismiss or take our leave of
them respectfully.</p>

<p class="gutsumm"><i>Account of the Gilds continued</i>.</p>
<p>After St. Gyles and St. Julian&rsquo;s Gild, the next, in the
Catalogue, is that of <i>St. Ethelered</i>, or
<i>Ethelred</i>.&nbsp; Of this Gild we have met with no
particular account; and but little more of the next to it, that
of <i>St. Margaret</i>: Parkin just mentions that it was founded
in the 8th of Henry IV. a patent being granted by that monarch
for that purpose. <a name="citation439a"></a><a
href="#footnote439a" class="citation">[439a]</a>&nbsp; Of <i>St.
Anne&rsquo;s</i> Gild, the 7th in the Catalogue, Parkin only
says, that there was here such a Gild, as appears by the
inquisition taken in the 3rd of Elizabeth.&nbsp; He also queres,
if there was not a chapel dedicated to St. Anne, somewhere near
the Fort which still bears her name? <a
name="citation439b"></a><a href="#footnote439b"
class="citation">[439b]</a> which seems very reasonable to
suppose.&nbsp; Of the next, the Gild of the 12 <i>Apostles</i>,
we have met with no further account; nor yet of that which
immediately succeeds it, the Gild of <i>St. Christopher</i>.</p>
<p>Of the 10th Gild, that of <i>our Lady</i>, the following
mention is made by Parkin&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;These are the brethren and sisters of the
Guild <i>Tigulat.</i> founded to the honour and purification of
the Blessed Virgin Mary, <i>ao.</i> 3 Edward III.&mdash;Thomas de
Langham, and Christian his wife; Charles de Secheford, and Alice
his wife; Robert de Derby, and Margery his wife; William, son of
the said Robert, &amp;c.&nbsp; [The names of the rest are not
given.]&nbsp; Robert seems to be alderman of the
Guild.&mdash;These are the four Morwespeches of the said Guild:
the first morwespeche is on the Sunday [<i>le Dymeynge
prochein</i>] after the purification of the Blessed Virgin, <a
name="page440"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 440</span>the second
on the day of the annunication of our Lady, the third on the day
of the assumption of our Lady, the fourth on the conception of
our Lady.&mdash;It is ordained that if any of the brethren be
summoned on any of the four morwespeches, and are in the said
town, and make default, they shall pay 1<i>d.</i> to the honour
of our Lady.&rdquo; <a name="citation440a"></a><a
href="#footnote440a" class="citation">[440a]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This Gild, as the above writer hints, had its Alderman, <a
name="citation440b"></a><a href="#footnote440b"
class="citation">[440b]</a> and likewise, probably, all the other
kind of officers mentioned in the account of St. Gyles and St.
Julian&rsquo;s Gild; with laws also somewhat alike those of that
fraternity; but its records relating to those matters having all
perished, nothing more can be said on those heads.&mdash;The
chapel of our Lady, which belonged to this Gild, or to which the
gild belonged, was not that <i>by the bridge</i>, to which it
gave name, but that <i>on the mount</i>, which was formerly a
very noted place in this town, both for its curious architecture
and its reputed sanctity&mdash;the offerings there sometimes
exceeding those of all our other holy places.&nbsp; But more of
these matters when we come to treat of the religious houses.</p>
<p>Of the five Gilds, mentioned in the Catalogue next after that
of <i>our Lady</i>, namely those of <i>St. Michael the
Archangel</i>, <i>St. Nicholas</i>, <i>St. Audrey</i>, <i>St.
Michael and King Henry</i>, and <i>St. Cyprian</i>, no particular
information has been obtained.&nbsp; We therefore know not how
they were constituted, or what were the particular objects of
their respective confederations.&nbsp; That <a
name="page441"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 441</span>the members
of all or of any of them were as useful and respectable in their
generation as those of St. Gyles and Julian can neither be
affirmed nor denied.&nbsp; They might be all very good sort of
people, in their way, for aught we know.&nbsp; But we may without
any breach of charity suppose they had their full share of
childish credulity and stupid superstition.&nbsp; These were the
predominant failings of their time, of which, however, even our
own time, and with all its boasted advantages and improvements,
is not yet quite clear.&nbsp; We must therefore suppose, that
they readily and implicity believed all the marvellous monkish
tales which were then propagated; especially those that
particularly related to their respective tutelar or patron
saints.&nbsp; The members of <i>St. Audrey&rsquo;s Gild</i>, for
instance, would all readily believe the extraordinary and
miraculous virtues ascribed to her wonderful <i>Smock</i> at
<i>Thetford</i>: and those of <i>our Lady&rsquo;s Gild</i> would
no less readily believe the wonderful accounts of her
<i>appearances</i> to divers persons in the very same town.&nbsp;
Thetford being so nigh to Lynn, and in the same county, the
miracles pretended to have been worked there would soon be
reported and credited here; and those, especially, that were
ascribed to <i>St. Audrey</i> and <i>Our Lady</i>, would be so
among the members of those Lynn Gilds which bore their names. <a

</blockquote>
<p>Such is the account we have of St. Fabian and St.
Sebastian&rsquo;s Gild.&nbsp; As it had <i>goods and chattels</i>
belonging to it, it was probably dissolved at the reformation,
like all others so circumstanced.&nbsp; Parkin calls it <i>mean
gild</i>: it might perhaps be so, compared with some of the
wealthier ones; but there is reason to believe that it was
superior to some of the <a name="page447"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 447</span>others.&nbsp; It had its <i>company
of minstrels</i>, which may be thought to answer to a modern
<i>band of music</i>, and seems to indicate that this society was
not among our meanest or lowest gilds.&nbsp; The number of its
members in the reign of Henry VIII. Parkin reckons to consist of
38, by the amount of the morspech pence; but if the officers were
exempted, from that payment, they might be no less than
45.&mdash;However that was, this gild in its days might answer
some very useful purposes.</p>
<p>Of the two Gilds named, in the catalogue, next after that of
St. Fabian and St. Sebastian, namely, those of <i>St. Lawrence
and St. Agnes</i>, nothing is known but the names: all the rest
seems to have gone long ago into irrecoverable oblivion.&mdash;Of
the next, the 19th Gild, that of <i>Corpus Christi</i>, something
more is known.&nbsp; Both Parkin and Mackerell have made some
mention of this ancient fraternity.&nbsp; The former speaks of it
as follows&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Licence was granted that John de Brunham,
and John Waryn, of Lenn, might give one messuage, 75<i>s.</i>
7<i>d.</i> <i>ob.</i> rent. with the appurtenances in Lenn, and
that Richard Dun might give the rent of 12<i>d.</i> and the
profit of one passage-boat beyond the port of the village of
Lenn, with the appurtenances, to Thomas de Couteshale, master of
the said guild, [as I take it] and the aforesaid John and Richard
might give to Thomas de Couteshale, one Shop and solar, with the
appurtenances in the said Village, which Thomas de Couteshale
holds.&mdash;John de Brunham, John de Perteneye, and Adam Skert,
burgess of Lynn, grant, &amp;c. to Jeffrey <a
name="page448"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 448</span>Talboth,
Thomas Botekysham, John de Dockyn, &amp;c. 2<i>s.</i> which they
used to receive of the heirs of John de Syssewell of West Lenne,
for the liberty of a ferry, of a passage-boat over the
water.&mdash;Dated at Lenn Bishop on Sunday after the feast of
the purification of the blessed Virgin, in the 3d. of Richard
II.&mdash;Jeffrey Talboth then mayor:&mdash;Witnesses John de
Tyteleshale, Roger Paxam, &amp;c.&rdquo; <a
name="citation448"></a><a href="#footnote448"
class="citation">[448]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hence it appears that this Gild had goods and chattels, was in
possession of a ferry boat, &amp;c.&nbsp; And must have been a
fraternity of some consequence.&nbsp; From Mackerell&rsquo;s
account it seems to be one of the commercial, or mercantile
gilds; what he says of it is contained in the following
passage&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>Of the Company of Merchants of</i> <span
class="smcap">Corpus Christi</span>, <i>their agreement</i>,
<i>and for what</i>.&mdash;This Indenture made witnesseth, that
John Pygot, burgels, merchant of Lynne Byshope, Master of the

href="#footnote449a" class="citation">[449a]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>From this last extract it is very evident that the Society of
Corpus Christi made no mean figure among the Lynn gilds.&nbsp;
The <i>Tabernacle</i> of Corpus Chisti, <a
name="citation449b"></a><a href="#footnote449b"
class="citation">[449b]</a> in the church of St. Margaret,
belonged to this Gild, and must have been attended with
considerable expense, both in its formation, and the subsequent
charges which it occasioned, for the lights that were there kept,
&amp;c.&nbsp; Indeed we are expressly told that they were a
<i>company of merchants</i>, and therefore we need not wonder
that they were, and could afford to be at more expense than most
of the others.&nbsp; In short, we may pretty safely conclude <a
name="page450"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 450</span>that this
must have been one of our most opulent Gilds.&nbsp; Had we known
more of its history we might be able to record some of its good
deeds, and prove that it deserved an honourable remembrance; but
as that is not the case, our account of it must be here
concluded.</p>
<h4><span class="smcap">Section</span> V.</h4>
<p class="gutsumm"><i>Account of the holy Trinity Company</i>,
<i>of great merchants&rsquo; Gild</i>.</p>
<p>Of all the Lynn gilds, that which assumed the name of
<i>Trinity</i>, and is the 20th in the Catalogue, appears to have
been by far the most eminent and opulent.&nbsp; It had very
considerable possessions, in houses, lands, and other sorts of
property; and there is still preserved a more particular and full
account of this gild than of most, or indeed of any of the rest:
of which its large landed property may be one principal reason,
as that could not well be conveyed into other hands without some
mention of its original or former possessors, and such mention
too as would be likely to be long remembered.&nbsp; Most, if not
all the property of this mercantile company, and particularly
what consisted in houses and lands, was, at the reformation, when
the company was dissolved, vested in the corporation, and still
constitutes a great part, or most, of their property of that
description.&nbsp; The best account of this gild, that we know
of, is contained in a MS. volume which once belonged to the <a
name="page451"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 451</span>late Henry
Partridge Esq. but is now the possession of our venerable
townsman Thomas Day Esq. who has very obligingly favoured the
present writer with the use of it.&nbsp; This account extends
much further than that given in Parkin&rsquo;s printed History of
Lynn, though it seems to have been originally drawn up by the
same hand, and transcribed from the papers of that eminent
antiquary, with his consent, by the procurement of the late Mr.
Partridge, in 1749.&mdash;We learn from the printed account, as
well as from that in manuscript, that though this gild is
<i>said</i> to have been <i>founded</i> by <i>king</i> <span
class="smcap">John</span>, at the request of his great favourite,
bishop De <i>Grey</i>, yet that, in fact, it existed long before
that time, as appears by an answer to a certain writ of enquiry,
in the reign of Richard II. so that what is called
<i>founding</i> it <i>then</i>, seems to mean no more than that
monarch&rsquo;s giving it his royal sanction, or taking it under
his kingly patronage: and we know not how far that proved of
material benefit to the institution.&nbsp; The interference and
patronage of statesmen have not always proved favourable to
commercial prosperity.&nbsp; But we will now proceed to lay
before the reader the account which we have obtained of this
gild.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;John de Grey bishop of Norwich persuaded <a
name="citation451"></a><a href="#footnote451"
class="citation">[451]</a> king <a name="page452"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 452</span>John to found the guild of the holy
Trinity at Lynn: the brethren of which were bound, under the
penalty of a gallon of wine, to have Mass celebrated every
Trinity Sunday, in St. Margaret&rsquo;s Church, for the souls of
the said king and bishop.&mdash;It was called the <i>great</i>
Guild of the holy Trinity in Lynn, in respect to other less
guilds in the same town; the head or chief person of this guild,
or fraternity, was stiled, the Alderman, or Custos, and was chose
by the commonalty of the said town, and continued so on that
choice for life, unless upon account of any great infirmity or
inability, or some other reasonable cause, he was set aside and
removed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This Guild was said to have <i>its rise and
begining</i> before the reign of king John, as appears from the
answer of Thomas Botesham, alderman of it, and his brethren, in
the time of Richard II. to a writ of enquiry of that king
relating to its foundation, authority, &amp;c. that its origin
was not known, that king John, considering the great concourse of
merchants to this town, granted the alderman that then was, and
the commonalty and their successors, by Letters patents, bearing
date in his sixth year, that they might have a guild of merchants
in the said town: and Henry III. son to the said king John, by
his Letters patents, granted one of their own body and community
to be mayor of the said town, which said mayor and alderman for
the time being, should always have the rule and government of it;
and which said alderman, in the vacancy of a mayor, or in the
absence of the mayor from the said town, should have the rule and
government of the said community, as the alderman <a
name="page453"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 453</span>and his
predecessors, the aldermen of the said town, had and enjoyed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As to <i>their possessions</i>, &amp;c. they are thus
returned to the aforesaid enquiry, That they had a place called
the Common Staith with its appurtenances, valued at 42<i>l.</i>
6<i>s.</i> 8<i>d.</i> per annum clear, besides all reprises, That
the goods and chattels of the aforesaid Guild amount in the whole
to 260<i>l.</i> 13<i>s.</i> viz. in ready money 60<i>l.</i>
13<i>s.</i>&nbsp; In divers merchandize 200<i>l.</i> and that in
many books, vestments, chalices, and other ornaments for the
chaplains of the said Guild performing Divine service as well in
the parish church as in the chapels <a name="citation453"></a><a
href="#footnote453" class="citation">[453]</a> annexed to the
said church, and that in wax for lights in the said church and
chapels, in the honour and laud of the holy Trinity, yearly
found, and for torches at the funerals of poor brethren, &amp;c.
of the said Guild, and that out of the profits of the common
Stathe, and out of the goods and chattels aforesaid, together
with diverse goods and chattels bequeathed and left to the said
Guild; the alderman, &amp;c. sustain and find <i>thirteen
chaplains</i>, daily and yearly to pray, as well for the king,
his ancestors, and for the peace and welfare of his kingdom, as
for the souls of all the aldermen, brethren, and benefactors of
the said Guild, also for the souls of all the faithful deceased:
<i>six</i> of which officiated in the church of St. Margaret
aforesaid, <i>four</i> in the chapel of St. Nicholas, and
<i>three</i> in the chapel of St. James in Lenne, who all day, as
they are stated and appointed in the church and chapels
aforesaid, celebrate high mass, by note, and on Sundays <a
name="page454"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 454</span>and other
festival days, celebrate mass at Mattins, and at Vespers, by
note; and if any of the aforesaid chaplains neglects his duty and
office, or is not of an honest life and conversation, when he has
been admonished by the alderman, and does not amend, he is
removed from the service, and the said alderman appoints another
able and honest one in his place.&nbsp; And further, that out of
the profits of the said Common-Stath, goods and chattels
aforesaid, many almsdeeds and works of charity were yearly given,
which, one year with another, are computed at 30<i>l.</i> viz.
towards the support of the poor brethren of the said guild, to
the blind, lame, and other distressed persons, to poor clerks
keeping school, and poor religious houses, as well of men as
women, to the lepers in and about Lenne, and in repairs &amp;c.
of the parish church and chapels aforesaid, and in the ornaments
of the same, together with the alms given to the four orders of
friers in Lenne, and to the maintaining of several aqueducts for
the use of the said town: all the goods and chattels aforesaid
are in the hands of the said alderman, and of four men of the
said guild, called skivins, <a name="citation454a"></a><a
href="#footnote454a" class="citation">[454a]</a> who yearly
distribute the said goods as aforesaid: and further, that the
brethren of the said guild never had nor used any one suit of
livery, either in their vestments or hoods.&rdquo; <a

chattels of the house, that they will employ the same faithfully
to the good of the guild, and will fully account and answer for
the profit.</p>

<p>The following additional articles are given, in the said MS.
volume, as <i>Usages and Customs</i> of the gild.</p>

in Whitsun week, on Friday after the exaltation of the Holy

<p>[13.]&nbsp; Likewise it was ordained, by common consent, that
the alderman and his brethren should take care that a solemn mass
should be celebrated for the soul of John de Grey, formerly
bishop of Norwich, who first obtained the liberty of the said
guild; viz. on the feast of the holy Trinity, where every one of
the brethren was to make an offering of an halfpenny, and if any
one made default, he was to give one sextary of wine to the alms
of the said house and gild.</p>

should hear together Vespers and Placebo for the soul of the
aforesaid king John and John [de] Grey bishop of Norwich, and on
the day following, on the feast of the holy Trinity, they should
all be there present, and hear the mass said of the holy Trinity,

the souls aforesaid.</p>

it was provided by common assent, for ever, that no brother ought
to buy or sell any millstones, or marble stones, brought to Lynn
to be sold, as long as the scabini of this house would buy them
for the profit of the guild and pay for them to the full, and if
any one brother should act contrary hereto, he should for ever be
deprived of the society.</p>
<p>[16.]&nbsp; On Friday the week of Pentecost the 24. Edward 3.
it was provided and agreed that every one of the skivins shall
faithfully and separately give in his account before the alderman

bought or sold, to whom he has sold, and for what price; and what
size every millstone was which he either bought or sold: and all

he does not, as is here provided, he shall give six pound of
silver to the use and profit of the said house, or be discharged

was provided and ordained unanimously by the alderman and the

belonging to the guild, according to the customs, &amp;c. of the
Burgh of Lynn, <a name="page464"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

year or have been elected the foregoing year shall every year at
the feast of St. John Baptist account with their tenants, and the
said tenants shall hire again of the said skivins the houses
which they shall hold beyond the term of the said St. John as the

convict and perjured person.</p>
<p>[20.]&nbsp; On Friday next after the feast of the exaltation
of the holy Cross, in the 31. of Edward 3. Jeffrey Drew then
alderman, it was unanimously agreed by the alderman and his
brethren, that as by the grant of the king in his charter the
Burgh of Lynn Epi. had this Liberty, that the burgesses of the
same in all fairs through the kingdom of England were free and
enjoyed that freedom; when therefore any one of the said
burgesses or brethren should go to the fair at Stirbridge, or
where any such like fair is held, and has taken his place by the
consent of any of the bailiffs of those places, and marked it out
by stakes or pins, by wood or stone, if any other burgess of
Lynn, or brother, either by presents <a name="page466"></a><span

of the aforesaid Liberty, and to be fined 40<i>s.</i> so that the
person so deprived and expelled may have 20<i>s.</i> of it; and
if the transgressor shall happen to be a brother of the said
gild, he shall be obliged by the alderman to pay 20<i>s.</i> for
the benefit of the said guild; and if the transgressor shall be a

<p><a name="page467"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 467</span>It is
very evident from the above extracts that the fraternity of the
<i>holy Trinity</i> stood very high among the Lynn Gilds; and
there is reason to believe that it far surpassed any of the rest
in power and opulence: of which the number of its
<i>chaplains</i> and the extent of its <i>possessions</i> may be
considered as very good and competent proofs.&nbsp; Of those
possessions we can form but a very imperfect idea from what has
been above said upon that subject.&nbsp; A much more correct and
adequate idea may be obtained from the charter of Edward VI.
after the dissolution of the gilds, in which the said possessions
are by him transferred or granted to the mayor and
burgesses.&mdash;This Charter bears date 21. May 1548, the 2nd

formerly laid out in defending the breaches of the sea, repairing
of banks, walls, fleets, and water courses, in Lynn aforesaid,

<p>This document makes it very clear, that our Trinity Gild had
acquired large possessions: nor is it to be concluded that the
above items, or specifications, constituted the whole of them;
their mercantile property and revenue, at least, are still to be
added, which cannot be supposed inconsiderable; and there might
be lands and tenements beside, that belonged to them, which the
king might not choose to include in the above grant.&nbsp;
However that was, it may be reasonably and safely presumed that
the possessions of this fraternity were much larger than those of
any of the rest, and that its weight and influence in the town
were also very considerable, not only exceeding those of any of
the others, but even, perhaps, of the corporation
itself.&mdash;Its 13 chaplains may be considered as a proof of
its great opulence, as well as of its assuming a very high
religious character, which was looked upon, it seems, in those
times, as essential to <a name="page473"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 473</span>the reputation and prosperity of all
social institutions, those of a civil and commercial, as well as
of an ecclesiastic nature.&nbsp; The case is not exactly so in
the present day.&nbsp; Between our present protestant
corporation, with <i>only two</i> chaplains, and this same gild
with <i>thirteen</i>, one may presume there must be what may be
called a pretty strong and striking contrast.&nbsp; We would fain
hope, however, that the advantage to the community lies very
materially on the protestant side.&mdash;Be that as it may, very
different from what it is at present must have been the state of
things at the period of which we are now treating, when the
members of a fraternity which comprehended the first families in
the town, were prohibited, as has been already remarked, to
appear before the alderman, or at the gild meetings,
<i>barefooted</i>; which clearly indicates that it was then
customary, for even the principal families, to go about,
ordinarily, <i>without shoes and stockings</i>.&nbsp; It was the
case, no doubt, with those of both sexes&mdash;shoes and
stockings constituting then only a part of the Sunday and holyday
dress, or the <i>full dress</i>, of even the people of the first
fashion in the place, such as the Bagges, the Everards, and the
Hoggs of those days: Nor are we warranted to conclude, that they
were, therefore, less respectable or less happy than their
successors of the present generation.&nbsp; It was the fashion in
those times, and it could affect neither their respectability nor
their happiness.</p>

<p class="gutsumm"><i>Account of the remaining Gilds</i>, <i>and
particularly those of</i> St. Francis and St. William.</p>
<p>Next, in the Catalogue, after the gild of the Trinity, are
those of St. Andrew, Holy Rood, St. Lovis, St. Austin, St.
Barbara, St. Antony, and St. Stephen; of none of which have we
been able to obtain any further information.&mdash;They were,
probably, fraternities of the lower sort; and having no large or
permanent possessions attached to them, such necessary records as
might exist among them would not be likely to remain to any
distant period.&nbsp; Whatever they were, they seem to have long
ago perished; and so, in all likelihood, had also their very
names, but for the laudable care and industry of the unknown
compiler of Mr. King&rsquo;s valuable MS. Volume, who, finding
them in some old record which fell in his way, thought proper to
transcribe and insert them among his curious collections and
memoranda.</p>
<p>Of the next gild, the 28th, in the catalogue, that of <i>St.
Francis</i>, the said MS. volume contains a very particular, and
what may also be called a very curious account.&nbsp; It has
preserved a copy, as it seems, of the incorporating instrument,
original agreement, or foundation deed of this gild.&nbsp; This
document is certainly uncouth enough, both as to style and
orthography: but as it may on that account be no less valuable or
interesting, it shall be here inserted, for the entertainment and
information of the curious and intelligent reader.&mdash;We find
that the Gild to which it relates was founded by a priest, or
friar, of the name of <i>John Wells</i>, who is called Sir John
Wells, it being customary in those days to <a
name="page475"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 475</span>prefix the
term, or title of <i>Sir</i>, mostly, if not always, to the name
of an ecclesiastic.&nbsp; He seems to have been also its alderman
in 1467, if he was not so from the time of its foundation, 13
years earlier.&mdash;The said Deed, or Instrument, reads as
follows.</p>

<p>It does not appear that the above Gild had a separate hall,
like some of the others, but met, as we have seen, in the abbey,
or monastery, of the Grey friars.&nbsp; It seems a very
remarkable fraternity, being a mixture of friars, or
ecclesiastics, and laics.&nbsp; Its very founder, and, seemingly,
its first alderman, and perhaps all its succeeding aldermen, were
of the monkish order, and therefore it may be supposed that that
description of members bore in it the principal sway, and had the
chief management in the direction of its affairs.&nbsp; However
that was, it might be in its time a very useful institution, and
productive of many valuable and important benefits to its
respective constituents.&nbsp; Like the other gilds it appeared
particularly attentive to what was then deemed sound doctrine in
regard to morality and religion; and, from the character of its
leading members, it may be supposed to have exceeded the others,
rather than fallen short of them, in the strictness of its
attention to those matters, as well as in the rigidness, or
severity of its general discipline.</p>
<p>The above extract, with all its uncouthness of style <a
name="page483"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 483</span>and
orthography, will yet, it is presumed and hoped, add to the value
of this work, at least, in the estimation of its most curious and
enlightened readers, who will be able to draw from it many useful
inferences, which are here necessarily omitted, in order to avoid
being too tiresome to others whom the author would wish to
gratify, and who probably constitute by far, the most numerous
part of the encouragers of this undertaking.&mdash;Dry and
insipid, as many, perhaps, will deem these old documents relating
to our gilds, they seem nevertheless to cast a greater light on
the state of society in this town, during the period now under
consideration, than any other materials that have fallen in the
way of the present writer, or whose existence lie within the
compass of his knowledge.</p>
<p>What now remains, before we dismiss this tedious subject, is
to say a few words respecting the three remaining gilds mentioned
in the catalogue.&nbsp; The next, or 29th in that list, is <i>the
gild of the Shoemakers</i>, which consisted, probably, of persons
of that occupation, or the brethren of the <i>gentle craft</i>,
as it has been sometimes called.&nbsp; They might be pretty
numerous then at Lynn; and yet it would seem rather odd if they
were so, when most of the inhabitants, those of the better sort
as well as others, seem to have been pretty much in the habit of
going about <i>barefooted</i>; unless it might be supposed that
shoes were then made here for exportation, as is now the case in
many places, where a great many more hands are employed, of
course, than is necessary for furnishing the population of those
places <a name="page484"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
484</span>with that article.&nbsp; This point, however, must be
left undetermined: all we know is, that, among the numerous Lynn
Gilds, one was called the <i>gild of the Shoemakers</i>, who,
whether very numerous or otherwise, seem to have been then a
thoughtful, provident, and brotherly set of people.</p>
<p>The 30th Gild was called the <i>Red Gild</i>.&nbsp; The reason
for giving it that name we are utterly unable to discover, or
even to conjecture.&nbsp; Nor do we know whether it was rich or
poor&mdash;consisted of many, or of but few members&mdash;managed
its affairs wisely or unwisely:&mdash;We just learn, that it was
called <i>the red gild</i>; and there our knowledge of it begins
and ends.&mdash;Some may, perhaps, be apt to suspect, that both
this and the preceding gild were no better than they ought to be,
in point of piety, or what in those days was so denominated, as
they did not assume the name of any saint, or angel, or sacred
object, like the other gilds, but went each of them, by a plain,
simple name, that had nothing in it sanctimonious, venerable, or
prepossessing.&nbsp; As the times went, it cannot be thought that
these two gilds could be in favour with the friars and the other
orders of religious functionaries: nor are we sure that they were
at all solicitous about it, or thought proper to employ a single
chaplain in their service.&nbsp; They might, however, not be the
worse for that, if they were duly attentive to those moral
obligations which they owed to one another, and to the rest of
their fellow-citizens.</p>
<p>The 31st Gild, and the last in the catalogue, had also, like
most of the others, a saint in its belly; and that <a
name="page485"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 485</span>saint was
the poor lad whom the Jews were said to have crucified at Norwich
in the 12th century, (as was before noted, at page <span
class="indexpageno"><a href="#page352">352</a></span>,) and whom
the pope sometime after canonized, under the name of <i>saint
William</i>. <a name="citation485"></a><a href="#footnote485"
class="citation">[485]</a>&nbsp; His patronage, no doubt, was as
effectual a guard to those good folks who chose to put themselves
under his protection as that of any other dead saint would have
been.&nbsp; This gild, as we are told, traded to North Bern,
which plainly implies, that it was another mercantile fraternity,
or gild of merchants.&nbsp; By <i>North Bern</i> is probably
meant North Bergen, or Bergen in Norway, with which country Lynn
appears to have carried on a considerable trade from a very
remote period.&nbsp; The connection between this town and those
parts was then so great that Lynn merchants usually resided
there: and there is to be seen in Mr. Day&rsquo;s MS. volume, p.
55, the copy of a Latin letter, of the date of 1305, from
Bartholomew, the king of Norway&rsquo;s chancellor, to the mayor
of Lynn, in behalf of Thurkill and other merchants resident
there.&nbsp; It was also customary for our merchants to have a
consul of their own, or alderman, as they called him, appointed
for Norway: for which purpose or appointment it was necessary, it
seems, to obtain a royal warrant.&nbsp; There is in Mackerell the
copy of such a warrant from Henry V. which runs thus&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Henry</span>, by the
grace of God, king of England and of France, and lord of Ireland;
to our trusty and well beloved the mayor, aldermen, and other
merchants inhabiting within our town <a name="page486"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 486</span>of Lynn, shewed unto us, that by the
old privilege among you, used in exercising the sale of your
merchandizes in the lands and countries of Denmark and Norway, ye
have an ancient custom to have an alderman chosen by election
among you to be ruler and governor of your company in the said
countries, and to see good rule and order kept among you there,
which we woll be content to help and see to be holden for the
increasing and augmentation of the common weal and prosperity of
you and all other our true subjects; we having the same in our
good remembrance, be content and woll, that ye gadre and assemble
toguider, and among you chuse such oon to be your said alderman,
as ye shall think convenient, good, honest, and sufficient for
the premisses; and to use, have, enjoy, and occupy the liberties
and franchises in this cause heretofore accustomed.&nbsp; Yeven
under our Signet at our Manor of Greenwich, the 18th. day of
July, the fifth year of our reign.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As to our Gild of St. William, that seems to have consisted of
mercantile adventurers who traded only to Bergen, which was
probably at that time the capital of Norway.&nbsp; It was perhaps
an opulent gild, but as none of its records are known now to
remain, we must here close our account of it, and so dismiss the
subject. <a name="citation486"></a><a href="#footnote486"

<p class="gutsumm">Account of the Monasteries and Religious
Houses that were formerly at Lynn.</p>
<p>From the fraternities called gilds the transition is pretty
short and natural to the monasteries and religious houses.&nbsp;
Of these there were here formerly a great many, the account of
some of which is so imperfect and confused, that it is difficult
to fix their exact number, or point out the places where they all
stood.&nbsp; The following were probably the chief of
them&mdash;1. A <i>Nunnery</i>, or Convent of Nuns: the site
unknown.&nbsp; 2. A <i>Priory of Benedictins</i>; situated in
Priory Lane.&nbsp; 3. A <i>monastery or Convent</i> of the
<i>Carmelites</i>, or <i>White Friars</i>; situated in South
Lynn.&nbsp; 4. Another of the <i>Grey-friars</i>, <i>Friars
minors</i>, or <i>Franciscans</i>; situated in Fuller&rsquo;s
Row, now St. James&rsquo;s Street.&nbsp; 5. Another of the
<i>Black Friars</i>, <i>preaching friars</i>, or
<i>Dominicans</i>; situated in Clough Lane, or rather between
that and Spinner Lane.&nbsp; 6. Another of <i>Austin Friars</i>,
or <i>Hermits </i><a name="page488"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
488</span><i>of the order of St Augustin</i>; situated in
Hogman&rsquo;s Lane, alias Hopman&rsquo;s Way, now St.
Austin&rsquo;s Street.&nbsp; 7. Another of <i>Friars de
Penitentia Jesu</i>; its site now unknown.&nbsp; 8. A
<i>College</i>; situated near the Town Hall; now inhabited by Mr.
Toosey.&nbsp; 9. <i>St. John&rsquo;s Hospital</i>; the site not
known.&nbsp; 10. <i>St. Mary Magdalen&rsquo;s Hospital</i>; its
site where the Gaywood Almshouse now stands.&nbsp; 11. <i>Four
Lazar Houses</i>; sites, it seems, at West Lynn, Cowgate,
Hardwick, and Gaywood.&mdash;To these may be added divers other
religious houses and chapels, such as those of <i>St.
James&rsquo;s</i>, <i>our Lady&rsquo;s on the Mount</i>, <i>our
Lady&rsquo;s on the Bridge</i>, <i>St. Anne&rsquo;s</i>, <i>St.
Catherine&rsquo;s</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i> the sites of some of which
appear not very easy now to mark out.&nbsp; They seem, all of
them, to have been laid by at the reformation, when the
dissolution of the monasteries and gilds took place: except the
<i>Nunnery</i> first above-mentioned; which had long before been
removed hence to Thetford.&nbsp; Concerning which removal we are
informed, that a certain priory of monks at Thetford being, in
1176, reduced to two, the Abbot of Bury persuaded them to resign;
upon which he placed in their stead a convent of nuns who had
previously resided at Lynn. <a name="citation488"></a><a
href="#footnote488" class="citation">[488]</a>&nbsp; But it is
not said how long their residence here had been, or for what
reason they were removed hence.&nbsp; Of the other convents,
&amp;c. we propose giving a further account, under the several
following subdivisions or sections.</p>
<h4><a name="page489"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
489</span><span class="smcap">Section</span> I.</h4>
<p class="gutsumm"><i>Account of the House of the Benedictins in
Priory lane</i>, <i>with a sketch of that religious
order</i>.</p>
<p>This House, or Priory, was founded by Herbert Lozinga, first
bishop of Norwich, in the reign of William Rufus. <a
name="citation489a"></a><a href="#footnote489a"
class="citation">[489a]</a>&nbsp; We are told that this house and
the church of St. Margaret were both built by bishop Herbert at
the request of the men of the town of Lenn; and that he, in order
to facilitate the undertaking, granted an indulgence of 40 days
pardon to all who should contribute towards it: also that he
settled the tithes and ecclesiastical dues of the whole town upon
this church and priory, and had the same confirmed by the
pope.&nbsp; He is also said to have given or settled upon them
all he had or possessed, as far as the church of William the son
of Stanquin, <a name="citation489b"></a><a href="#footnote489b"
class="citation">[489b]</a> on the other side of Scwaldsfeld, in
rents, lands, and men, <a name="citation489c"></a><a
href="#footnote489c" class="citation">[489c]</a> except Seman and
his land, and the saltwork which the mother of Seman held.&nbsp;
He likewise granted the Saturday mercate, and the Fair on St.
Margaret&rsquo;s day to this house, or rather to his great house
the priory of the Holy Trinity at Norwich, to which this priory
of Lynn was a cell.&nbsp; The said bishop also gave them the new
mill in Gaywode marsh, with that marsh, the churches of Gaywode
and Mintling, the priest at Mintling, the tithes of his demeans
at Gaywode, with a villain called Edward, and all his land; also
his saltworks in the said town, except two, and <a
name="page490"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 490</span>that which
Leofric, son of Limburgh held, and the mother of Seman: also the
church of Sedgford with the tithes, and all that Walter the
archdeacon had, as he held it; the church of Thornham, with the
tithes and all belonging to it; his land at Fringes, with 70
acres of land in Sedgeford, free and quit of all service, with
the land of Owen of Lakesle. <a name="citation490"></a><a
href="#footnote490" class="citation">[490]</a>&nbsp; Thus were
the donations or endowments specified.</p>
<p>This Lynn Priory being accounted only a cell to the Priory of
Norwich, that house appointed a monk of their body to be prior
here at Lynn, who was responsible to the priory of Norwich for
the rents and profits he received, and seems to have been
removable at pleasure.&nbsp; Many other grants were afterwards by
succeeding bishops made to this priory, as may be seen at large
in Blomefield and Parkin.</p>
<p>This house stood on the north side of Priory Lane, which took
its name from it; but it took up a considerable part of the
ground between that lane and the church, and seems to have been a
pretty extensive building.&nbsp; Its prior, though subordinate to
him of Norwich, and removable by him and his monks at their
pleasure, was yet a person of no small consequence among the
monks of Lynn, as well as in the estimation of the
inhabitants.&nbsp; He was, no doubt, looked up to, for many ages,
and esteemed among the principal personages of the place: but he
is no longer remembered; and in a few years the present heads of
the town will be as little thought of.&nbsp; <a
name="page491"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 491</span>After the
dissolution, the Lynn Priory was partly pulled down, to enlarge
the church yard.&nbsp; What was then left was in time removed,
and scarcely any remains of it now exist, except what may be
discovered in some of the walls of the old dwellings on the north
side of the lane.&nbsp; The monks of this house, at one time,
according to Parkin, were grown so rich, beyond the design of the
founder, as to endanger the bishop&rsquo;s preponderance in the
place; which occasioned bishop De Grey, who then filled the see,
to take measures for reducing their power and securing his own,
by making an exchange with the priory of Norwich, of lands or
possessions belonging to them here, for other lands belonging to
his see elsewhere.&nbsp; A copy of the bishop&rsquo;s deed for
this purpose has been preserved by Parkin, <a
name="citation491a"></a><a href="#footnote491a"
class="citation">[491a]</a> as have been also many particulars
relating to this priory, which, though not altogether
uninteresting, must be here omitted.</p>
<p>The Benedictine order, to which the monks of this house
belonged, is of considerable antiquity.&nbsp; It was instituted,
according to Mosheim <a name="citation491b"></a><a
href="#footnote491b" class="citation">[491b]</a> <span
class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 529, by <span
class="smcap">Benedict</span> of <i>Nursia</i>, a man of piety
and reputation for the age he lived in.&nbsp; From his
<i>rule</i> of discipline, which is yet extant, we learn that it
was not his intention to impose it upon all the monastic
societies, but to form an order whose discipline should be
milder, their establishment more solid, and their manners more
regular, than those of the other monastic bodies; and whose
members during the course of a holy and peaceful life, were <a
name="page492"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 492</span>to divide
their time between prayer, reading, the education of youth, and
other pious and learned labours.&nbsp; But in process of time the
followers of this celebrated ecclesiastic degenerated sadly from
the piety of their founder, and lost sight of the duties of their
station and the great end of their establishment.</p>
<p>Having acquired immense riches from the devout liberality of
the opulent, they sunk into luxury, intemporance, and sloth,
abandoned themselves to all sorts of vices, extended their peal
and attention to worldly affairs, insinuated themselves into the
cabinets of princes, took part in political cabals and court
factions, made a vast augmentation of superstitious rites and
ceremonies in their order, to blind the multitude and supply the
place of their expiring virtue; and, among other
<i>meritorious</i> enterprizes, laboured most ardently to swell
the arrogance, by enlarging the power and authority, of the Roman
pontif.&nbsp; The good Benedict never dreamt that the great
purposes of his institution were to be thus perverted, much less
did he give any encouragement or permission to such flagrant
abuses.&nbsp; His rule of discipline was neither favourable to
luxury nor ambition; and it is still celebrated on account of its
excellence, though it has not been observed for many years.</p>
<p>The same writer observes, that this order made a most rapid
progress in these western parts, and in a short time arrived at
the most flourishing state.&nbsp; &ldquo;In <i>Gaul</i> its
interests were promoted by <span class="smcap">Maurus</span>; in
<i>Sicily</i> and <i>Sardinia</i> by <span
class="smcap">Placidus</span>; in <i>Italy</i>, &amp;c. by <span
class="smcap">Gregory</span> the <span
class="smcap">Great</span>; <a name="page493"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 493</span>in <i>England</i>, by <span
class="smcap">Augustin</span> and <span
class="smcap">Mellitus</span>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Its sudden and
amazing progress as ascribed by the Benedictins to the wisdom and
sanctity of their discipline, and to the miracles which were
worked by their founder and his followers.&nbsp; But a more
attentive view of things will convince the impartial observer,
that the protection of the Roman pontifs, to the advancement of
whose grandeur and authority the Benedictins were most servilely
devoted, contributed much more to the lustre and influence of
their order, than any other circumstance, nay, than all other
considerations united together.&nbsp; In the ninth century the
credit and power of those of this order became so great and
predominant as actually to absorb all the other religious
societies, and hold unrivalled the reins of monastic
empire.&nbsp; But by that time, and therefore long before their
settlement at Lynn, they had departed from their original
simplicity and were become a degenerate and corrupt order.&nbsp;
Consequently it is not very likely that its establishment here
could be of any very substantial or important advantage to our
ancestors.</p>

<p class="gutsumm"><i>Account of the convent of the Carmes</i>,
<i>Carmelites</i>, <i>or White Friars</i>, <i>in South Lynn</i>,
<i>with a sketch of that religious order</i>.</p>
<p>This House stood close to the river Lenn or Nar, in the field
now called <i>the friars</i>.&nbsp; All the remains of it have
long disappeared, except the Gateway or Gate-house, which is
supposed to have been the principal <a name="page494"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 494</span>entrance into the place.&nbsp; It is
said to be founded about 1269, by the lord Bardolph of that time;
though others say that the founder was Thomas de Feltsham, but
that the lord Bardolph, the lord Scales, and Sir John Wigenhale
were also considerable benefactors to it.&nbsp; William le Breton
was also among its benefactors in the reign of Henry III. having
endowed it with lands in South Lynn, Burgh Green, Dillingham and
other places, in Norfolk and Cambridgeshire.&nbsp; William lord
Randolph, who died in the 9th of Richard II. was buried
here.&nbsp; In the 12th of the same reign these monks had a
patent for the rent of ten quarters of <i>frumenti</i>, and ten
quarters of barley, to receive them annually of the manor of Stow
Bardolph, granted by John lord Bardolph.&mdash;April 13th, 1379,
Sir Hamon Felton, of Litcham willed his body to be buried in the
church of the Carmes, at Lynn.&nbsp; The noble family of Hastings
also appear to have been great benefactors to this
house.&mdash;From all these circumstances it may be very plainly
seen, that this convent was a place of considerable note and
reputation, and that, probably, for many ages.&nbsp; But nothing
could save it from that dissolution which all such places
experienced in the memorable reign of Henry VIII.&mdash;The site
of it was then purchased by John Eyre Esq. who was one of that
king&rsquo;s auditors or receivers; and he conveyed it to a
priest, from whom the corporation purchased it, who have been in
possession of it ever since.&nbsp; How long after that it was
suffered to stand does not appear.&nbsp; The Steeple was probably
that part of it which stood the longest, except the Gatehouse
above-mentioned.&nbsp; The said Steeple appears to have stood
near a 100 years after the <a name="page495"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 495</span>dissolution: it fell, as we are
told, for want of due repair, on the 9th of April 1631, after
having stood upwards of 360 years.&nbsp; Where this lofty steeple
and the great church and convent of the Carmelites stood for so
many ages, not a stone is now left upon another.&nbsp; A plain
field or pasture is all that is now to be seen; just as if such
an extensive edifice had never existed or stood there.&nbsp; The
case is much the same with the other Lynn monasteries, except
that of the Grey Friars, whose steeple still remains, owing to
more attention being paid to the keeping of it in repair.</p>
<p>The Carmelites, together with the Franciscans, Dominicans, and
Augustinians, constituted the four famous orders of Mendicants:
and it is somewhat remarkable that they all established
themselves at Lynn, and had the whole town, in a manner, divided
among themselves, which seems not to have been unusual with them.
<a name="citation495"></a><a href="#footnote495"
class="citation">[495]</a>&mdash;<a name="page496"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 496</span>Of the present order, that of the
Carmes, or Carmelites, the following account will give the
reader, it is presumed a sufficiently correct idea.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;About the middle of this century (the 12th)
a certain Calabrian, whose name was <i>Berthold</i>, set out with
a few companions for mount Carmel, and there, upon the very spot
where the prophet Elias is said to have disappeared, built an
humble cottage with an adjoining chapel, in which he led a life
of solitude, austerity, and labour.&nbsp; This little colony
subsisted, and the places of those that died were more than
filled by new comers; so that it was at length erected into a
monastic community by <i>Albert</i>, patriarch of
Jerusalem.&nbsp; This austere prelate drew up a rule of
discipline for the new monks, which was afterwards confirmed by
the authority of the Roman pontiffs, who modified and altered it
in several respects, and among other corrections mitigated its
excessive rigour and severity.&nbsp; Such was the origin of the
famous <i>Order of Carmelites</i>, or, as they are commonly
called, of the <i>Order of our Lady of mount Carmel</i>, which
was afterwards transplanted from <i>Syria</i> into <i>Europe</i>,
and obtained the principal <a name="page497"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 497</span>rank among the mendicant or begging
orders.&nbsp; It is true the Carmelites reject, with the highest
indignation, an origin so recent and obscure, and affirm to this
very day, that the prophet Elias was the founder of their ancient
community.&nbsp; Very few, however, have been engaged to adopt
this fabulous and chimerical account of their establishment,
except the members of the order, and many Roman Catholic writers
have treated their pretensions to such a remote antiquity with
the utmost contempt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Scarcely, indeed, (says Maclaine) can any thing be more
ridiculous than the circumstantial narrations of the occasion,
origin, founder, and revolutions of this famous order, which we
find in several ecclesiastical authors.&nbsp; They tell us, that
<i>Elias</i> was introduced into the state of monachism by the
ministry of angels; that his first disciples were <i>Jonah</i>,
<i>Micah</i>, and also <i>Obadiah</i>, whose wife, in order to
get rid of an importunate crowd of lovers, who fluttered about
her at the court of <i>Achab</i> after the departure of heir
husband, bound herself by a vow of chastity, received the veil by
the hand of <i>father</i> <span class="smcap">Elias</span>, and
thus became the first abbess of the Carmelite order.&nbsp; They
enter into a vast detail of all the circumstances that relate to
the rules of discipline, which were drawn up for this community,
the habit which distinguished its members, and the various
alterations which were introduced into their rule of discipline
in process of time.&nbsp; They observe, that among other marks
which were used to distinguish the Carmelites from the <a
name="page498"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 498</span>seculars,
the <i>tonsure</i> was one; that this mark of distinction exposed
them, indeed to the mockeries of a profane multitude; and that
this furnishes the true explication of the term <i>bald-head</i>,
which the children addressed, by way of reproach, to
<i>Elishah</i>, as he was on his way to <i>Carmel</i>. (2 Kings
ii. 23)&nbsp; They tell us, moreover, that even <i>Pythagoras</i>
was a member of this ancient order; that be drew all his wisdom
from mount <i>Carmel</i>, and had several conversations with the
prophet <i>Daniel</i> at <i>Babylon</i>, upon the subject of the
Trinity.&nbsp; Nay they go still further into the region of
fable, and assert, that the Virgin <i>Mary</i> and <i>Jesus</i>
himself assumed the habit and profession of Carmelites; and they
load this fiction with a heap of absurd circumstances, which it
is impossible to read without the highest astonishment.&rdquo; <a
name="citation498"></a><a href="#footnote498"
class="citation">[498]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Carmelites came into England in 1240, and appear to have
obtained an establishment at Lynn not a very long while
after.&nbsp; What sort of men they were, the reader can now form
some idea.</p>

class="citation">[499b]</a> the very same person, probably, he
mentions as one of the reputed founders of the Carmelite Convent,
though the name is somewhat differently spelt.&nbsp; Parkin says,
that the Grey Friars settled here about the 52d. of Henry III, (a
date, by the bye, somewhat later than that given above,)
&ldquo;and built this convent near Synolf&rsquo;s fleet, on which
the mill formerly called Swagg&rsquo;s mill, afterwards the
common mill, or town mill, stands.&rdquo;&nbsp; That mill,
however, has long ago ceased to stand there, though the memory of
it is still preserved in the name of the adjoining lane, which is
yet called <i>mill lane</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;In 1287, (as the same
writer informs us) on Monday August 7, in the court at Lenn, Adam
de St. Omer being then mayor, and Richard de Walsingham, steward,
Richard Sefull gave by deed 12<i>d.</i> rent <i>per ann</i>.
which his ancestors used to receive out of a certain area by the
church-yard of Saint James&rsquo;s to the west, which the said
Adam de St. Omer purchased of Adam Silvester, for the enlarging
of the area, where the Friars Minors now inhabit.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
also says, that Bernard le Estree, within the same year,
purchased of William de Lindesey, in St. James&rsquo;s Street, a
certain area, and gave it to enlarge the friars minors&rsquo;
area.&nbsp; In the 7th of Edward II, as we are further told,
these friars had a patent for bringing the water to their house
from a spring in North Runcton, called Bukenwell.&nbsp; In the
38th of Edward III, they had a patent for two messuages to
enlarge their manse.&nbsp; From the same writer we also learn,
that Richard Peverel, Esq. <a name="page500"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 500</span>of Tilney, by will, dated March 15,
1423, bequeath his body to be buried in the church of the friars
minors of Lynn Bishop, appoints Mr. John Spencer, vicar of
Tilney, his executor&mdash;proved May 15, 1424.&mdash;The said
testator also left a house of 10<i>l.</i> value to the duke of
Exeter, to be supervisor of his will, of whom he held
lands.&nbsp; This is the chief of what Parkin relates of the Lynn
Grey Friars and their convent; except that the house was
surrendered by the Warden and nine brethren Oct. 1, the 1539, the
30th of Henry VIII.&mdash;It is some what remarkable that the
steeple or tower of this edifice, or of the church of the Grey
Friars, though apparently but of slight construction, has
survived all the rest, and is still standing: and it may,
possibly, with proper attention, stand yet many years.&nbsp; The
Dominicans, and Augustinians had probably their towers also, as
well as the Carmelites, but they have all long ago
disappeared.</p>

<p>Of this famous order of mendicants it will not be easy,
perhaps, to give the reader a better idea that by laying before
him the following outline of the history and character of its
founder, commonly called <i>saint Francis</i>.&nbsp; This
distinguished personage appeared a short time before his equally
distinguished contemporary St. <i>Dominic</i>.&nbsp; He was born
in 1182, at Assisi, in Umbria.&nbsp; In his youth he is said to
have been of a debauched and dissolute character, but at 25,
after his recovery from a severe fit of illness, occasioned by
his licentious course of life, he became so wholly religious, and
so unfit for any other business, that his father threatened to
disinherit him; to which he was so far from having any objection
<a name="page501"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 501</span>that, in
presence of the bishop of Assisi, he solemnly disclaimed all
expectation from him, and declared that from that time he would
acknowledge only his father in heaven.&nbsp; He is said to have
then devoted himself to works of charity of the most humiliating
kind: and being one day at church, hearing mass, he was so
forcibly struck with those words, Matt. x. 9.&nbsp; <i>Provide
neither gold</i>, <i>nor silver</i>, <i>nor brass in your
purses</i>, <i>nor scrip for your journey</i>, <i>neither two
coats</i>, <i>neither shoes</i>, <i>nor yet staves</i>, <i>for
the workman is worthy of his meat</i>; that he cried out
&ldquo;This is what I seek!&rdquo; and immediately threw away his
shoes, staff, wallet, and all his money, and kept only one
coat.&nbsp; He also laid aside his girdle, which was of leather,
and made use of a piece of rope in its stead.&nbsp; From this
time, in imitation of the apostles, he began to exhort other
persons to <i>repent</i>; and he did it in a very forcible
manner, and with wonderful success, always beginning his
discourse with saying &ldquo;God give you
peace.&rdquo;&mdash;When he had got <i>three</i> disciples, they
dispersed, to preach in different places.&nbsp; Some received
them with great humanity, looking with astonishment on their
extraordinary dress and great austerities, while others made a
mock of them and abused them: this however they bore very
patiently.</p>
<p>When he had <i>seven</i> disciples, he exhorted them to go to
different countries, preaching repentance, without regarding any
treatment they might meet with; assuring them that in a short
time many learned and noble would join them, and they would
preach to kings and princes, as well as to the common
people.&nbsp; When he had <i>eleven</i> <a
name="page502"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 502</span>disciples,
one of whom was a priest, he wrote out a rule for them, taken
wholly out of the Gospels, and presented it to pope Innocent III,
who, after making some objection, approved of it, in
1210.&mdash;Having obtained this confirmation of his institute,
Francis went with 12 disciples and established himself in a
church which he had repaired at Pontremoli, and this was the
first house of his order, which, by way of humility, he called
that of the <i>minor brethren</i>, <i>frates minores</i>, in
French <i>feres</i>, in English by corruption <i>friars</i>, as
the Dominicans had at the same time assumed the name of
<i>preaching brothers</i>, or friars.&mdash;From this place they
went forth preaching in the neighbouring towns and villages, not
with studied harangues, (but like the methodists of our time) in
a manner that made uncommon impression upon the hearers, as they
had the appearance of men of another world, having their faces
always turned towards those regions whither they were continually
directing their audience.&mdash;In 1211 they founded several
convents, the most considerable of which were those of Cottona,
Pisa, and Bologna; and Francis himself, having preached through
all <i>Tuscany</i>, returned to Assisi, in Lent, 1212.</p>
<p>In such veneration was he held at this time, that when he went
into any city, they rung the bells, and the clergy and people
went to meet him, bearing branches of trees, and singing,
thinking themselves happy, who could kiss his hands or
feet.&nbsp; That Lent he preached at his native place, where he
had many converts, and among them St. <i>Claire</i>, a young
woman of a noble family, who by his direction, though only at the
age of eighteen, <a name="page503"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
503</span>abandoned the world, and notwithstanding the
remonstrances of her relations, fixed herself in a monastery,
first at St. Ange de Pansa, where she was joined by her sister
<i>Agnes</i>, and then at St. Damien of the order of the
Benedictines, which was the first church St. Francis had
repaired.&nbsp; Here she continued 42 years, many disciples
joining her; and thus was formed the order of <i>poor women</i>,
or that of <i>St. Claire</i>, being the second order of
Franciscans.</p>
<p>About 1216, he gave instructions for his disciples to go in
pairs, as the Apostles had done.&nbsp; Thus they went into Spain,
Provence, and Germany, into which country he sent no less than 60
brothers.&mdash;So rapidly did the order now increase, that at a
chapter general held in 1219, when Dominic was present, there
appeared to be not less than 5000 in it; though they had not been
established more than 9 or 10 years.&mdash;In June, 1219, pope
Honorious III issued a bull, addressed to all bishops,
recommending the Franciscans as apostolical men.&mdash;Many
women, now converted by his preachers, formed themselves into
monasteries, but he refused to take charge of any of them, except
that of St. Claire.</p>
<p>After this he sent his chief disciples into distant countries
with a number of companions, taking for himself and 12 others the
mission of <i>Syria</i> and <i>Egypt</i>.&nbsp; They went forth
in the spirit of confessors and martyrs; for when men expose
themselves to almost certain death, there cannot be a doubt of
their being in earnest.&nbsp; Two going to Africa endeavoured to
go into a mosque; and <a name="page504"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 504</span>preaching in the streets, and
putting themselves in the way of the king, he first ordered them
to be confined; but as they continued their importunity, he was
so enraged, that he struck off their heads with his own hands,
while they suffered with great resignation.&nbsp; Francis himself
went to Egypt, during the siege of Damieta, and getting access to
the Sultan, he offered to go into the fire in proof of the truth
of his religion.&nbsp; But the Sultan, who heard him with great
patience, did not choose to put him to the test, but admiring his
courage, dismissed him with much good humour, desiring him to
pray to God, that he would shew him what religion was most
agreeable to him.&nbsp; In 1221, seven went to Ceuta to preach to
the Moors; but they were soon apprehended, and not yielding to
the command of the king to turn Mahometans, they were all
beheaded. <a name="citation504"></a><a href="#footnote504"
class="citation">[504]</a></p>
<p>In the Rule of the Franciscans, which was fully confirmed in
1213, by Pope Nicholas III, besides engaging to live in obedience
to their superior, in chastity, and without property, they also
vowed obedience to the pope and his successors.&nbsp; These
orders of mendicants, particularly this and that of St. Dominic,
were of much greater use in support of the papal hierarchy, and
combating heretics than all the orders of monks had ever
been.&nbsp; Such was the number of persons in this period <a
name="page505"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 505</span>disaffected
to the see of Rome, that it is very doubtful whether without this
seasonable assistance it could have been supported at all.&nbsp;
In this view we cannot contemplate their labours without regret:
but even here they may not have been more blameable than some of
our present religious orders, who, though seemingly well meaning
people, are ever ready to defend, or at least to make excuses for
almost every species of corruption.</p>
<p>St. Francis pretended, or, at least, his adherents did so,
that the particulars of his rule had been dictated to him by God
himself.&nbsp; It is also said of him that retiring to Mount
Alverne on the borders of Tuscany, in 1224, to pass the Easter,
he saw in a vision the appearance of Christ on the cross,
descending from heaven; and when he awoke he found all the marks
of crucifixion on his own body.&nbsp; Such tales were doubtless
invented to magnify his name and promote the credit of the
order.&nbsp; They might answer then, and still in some places;
but they are not here introduced as worthy of belief.&nbsp; The
Franciscans came into England in the reign of Henry III, and in
that same reign established themselves in this town: but their
first establishment in England is said to have been at
<i>Canterbury</i>.&nbsp; Of the probable effects of their making
Lynn one of their head quarters, or places of residence, the
reader must now form his own opinion. <a

<p class="gutsumm"><i>Account of the convent of the Black
Friars</i>, <i>Preaching Friars</i>, <i>or Dominicans</i>, <i>in
Clough Lane</i>, <i>with a Sketch of that famous order</i>.</p>
<p>Of this convent, (once perhaps inferior to none of the rest,
if indeed it did not exceed them all, both in size and
magnificence,) nothing is now to be seen but some old walls,
whose thickness and massy appearance seem to indicate that they
once sustained a large and sumptuous fabric.&nbsp; It was
founded, as Parkin says, by Thomas Gedney, who was then, no
doubt, a great and leading character in these parts.&nbsp; The
above author does not seem to know the exact time when this
convent was built, but it must have been sometime previous to
1272, for he assures us that these friars were then here.&nbsp;
Indeed he says also, that they settled here about the time the
Grey Friars did, as appears from a writ, <i>Ad quod damnum</i>,
for a fountain or spring granted them in Middleton, by William,
lord Bardolph, called Brokewell, and a certain aqueduct coming
from that spring to their convent at Lynn; (for which he refers
to <i>Esch. in Turri Lond.</i> A&ordm;. 21, <i>Edw.</i> I.
N&ordm;. 71.)&nbsp; We may therefore fairly conclude, that this
convent was built almost, if not altogether as early as that of
the Grey Friars.</p>
<p>The following is the chief of what that writer has further
said, relating to this convent.&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Thomas Thorndon aliened to these friars
preachers a piece of land 18 feet long and 21 broad, in Lenn
Episcopi, in the 3d. of Edw. III.&nbsp; In the same year these
friars had a patent to enlarge their house here.&mdash;Simon
Parche, <i>alias</i> Tyler, of Watlyngton, Norfolk, wills, in
1442, to be buried <a name="page507"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
507</span>in the chancel of the friars preachers, or black
friars, of Lyn, and gives to the fabrick, de la stalles in the

Norw.&mdash;The chapel of St. Catherine, in the church of the
friars preachers, mentioned in 1497.&nbsp; Reg. Sayve.
Norw.&mdash;The image of our Lady in the body of the
church.&rdquo; <a name="citation507"></a><a href="#footnote507"
class="citation">[507]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of this convent, as well as that of the Carmelites, we are
also told that an <i>anchorage</i> belonged to it: by which we
are probably to understand, a place in the harbour for mooring
ships, or a certain duty, payable by the ships there moored to
the said convents.&nbsp; The ground in all ports and harbours
being considered as the king&rsquo;s, this anchorage may be
supposed to have been a grant from the crown to those two orders
of friars at Lynn.</p>
<p>The same writer further informs us that this convent of
Dominicans was surrendered by the prior and eleven brethren on
the 30th of Sept. 1539, 30th of Henry VIII.&nbsp; Its site, as we
further learn, was granted, about six years after, to John Eyre
Esq. with land there in the tenure of John Kempe.&nbsp; This John
Ayre, (our author adds) on the dissolution had 37 messuages, 9
gardens, in the tenure of divers persons, given him by the said
king in his 36th year, and messuages and tenements called Bishops
Stath, and an house called the Steward&rsquo;s Hall, with other
messuages and lands here, belonging to the see of Norwich.&nbsp;
The site of this convent the said John Eyre conveyed to a priest,
from whom it came to <a name="page508"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 508</span>Thomas Waters, of &mdash;, who had
Edward Waters, and a daughter married to George Baker.&nbsp; The
said Edward&rsquo;s son in law, Sir John Bolls, of Scampton, in
Lincolnshire, Bt. sold it to one Killingtree, since which time it
seems to have passed through a great many hands.&nbsp; The said
site at present is thought to be partly the property of the
corporation, and partly that of the Carey family.&nbsp; About the
garden of the chief mansion of that family are several scattered
remains of this ancient edifice.&nbsp; We shall next endeavour to
acquaint the reader with the character of that religious order,
or fraternity for whose use this convent was originally erected,
and in whose occupation it ever after continued.</p>
<p>The Dominicans, although their settlement at Lynn was not
anterior to that of the Franciscans, yet they appear to have
found their way to England a good many years before them: for we
are told, that Dominic, just before his death, sent <i>Gilbert de
Fresney</i>, with twelve of the brethren into England, where they
founded their first monastery at Oxford in 1221, and soon after
another at London.&nbsp; In the latter place they became in time
so popular, and so much in favour with the corporation, that, in
1276, the mayor and aldermen, as we are told, gave them two whole
streets by the river Thames, where they erected a very commodious
convent, whence that place is still called <i>Black-Friars</i>,
for so they were called in this country, <a
name="citation508"></a><a href="#footnote508"
class="citation">[508]</a> perhaps from the colour of the
habit.&nbsp; <a name="page509"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
509</span>They were also called <i>Friars preachers</i>, or
<i>preaching friars</i>, from <i>preaching</i> being their chief
object, employment, or profession; and <i>Dominicans</i>, from
the name of their memorable founder; an epitome, or outline of
whose history and character we shall here subjoin.&nbsp; It will
enable the reader, it is hoped, or, at least, help him in some
measure, to form a pretty correct estimate of the merits and
demerits of these predicant friars; as it may be very confidently
and safely expected that they resembled their leader, according
to the old adage &ldquo;Like master like man.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Dominic</span>, commonly called <i>Saint
Dominic</i>, the father of the Dominicans, was a
<i>Spaniard</i>.&nbsp; He was surnamed <i>de Guzman</i>, being
descended from an ancient and noble family of that name.&nbsp;
Having finished his studies at Palencia, he was made canon, and
afterwards archdeacon of Osma in Castille, and then professor of
Theology at Placentia.&nbsp; But this he quitted to go to preach
after the manner of Francis, which he did in several parts of
Spain, giving proof in the meantime of great charity towards the
poor and afflicted.&nbsp; Coming into France with the bishop of
Osma, he greatly distinguished himself by preaching against the
<i>Albigenses</i>, and there he formed the design of instituting
an order of <i>preachers</i>.&nbsp; Fulk bishop of Thoulouse
brought him to the council of <i>Lateran</i>, in 1215, that he
might be examined by the pope.&nbsp; His holiness approving of
the scheme <a name="page510"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
510</span>of Dominic, the latter consulted with his followers,
when they agreed to adopt the rules of <i>St. Austin</i>, but
with several additions.&nbsp; They resolved to have no estate in
lands, but only revenues.&nbsp; They were then sixteen in number,
and the bishop of Thoulouse gave them their first church, that of
St. Romanus in that city; and near it he built cloisters, with
cells over them, where they might study and sleep.&nbsp; Pope
Honorious III. confirmed the order in 1216, exempting them from
paying tithes of their possessions, and ordering that they should
depend upon the diocesan for episcopal functions; and the prior
to be chosen by the free votes of the brethren: so that the
Dominicans, at their first institution, were not <i>beggars</i>,
nor exempt from episcopal jurisdiction, but canons regular.</p>
<p>Next year Dominic sent out his followers in pairs, after
choosing a superior, to whom he gave the tide of <i>abbot</i>;
but all the succeeding ones were called <i>masters</i>, and the
superiors of particular houses <i>priors</i>.&nbsp; He sent four
to Spain, four to France, and two more to study there.&nbsp;
Hearing of the death of that ferocious and bloody crusader, Simon
de Montfort, at the siege of Thoulouse, Dominic went thither to
comfort the brethren.&nbsp; Thence, in 1218, he went into Spain,
and founded two monasteries, one at <i>Madrid</i>, and the other
at <i>Segovia</i>.&nbsp; Thence he went to Paris, where he found
thirty brethren: thence he proceeded to Bologna, where Arnauld,
who joined him at Rome, had been very successful, and had formed
a large society.&nbsp; Going to Parma, he there met St. Francis,
of whom he seemed to entertain <a name="page511"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 511</span>a very high opinion, when, after
conferring together, they agreed not to accept of church livings:
which might suggest to Dominic the idea of that profession of
poverty which he afterwards imposed upon those of his order. <a
name="citation511"></a><a href="#footnote511"
class="citation">[511]</a></p>
<p><a name="page512"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 512</span>In
1220 he made some new and more rigorous regulations respecting
the <i>nuns</i>.&nbsp; In the same year he held the first chapter
general of his order at Bologna, when it was resolved that the
preaching friars should profess perfect <i>poverty</i>, and make
that the fundamental principle of their order.&nbsp; It was now
agreed that these chapters should be held every year, at Paris
and Bologna alternately.&nbsp; At the second chapter general at
Bologna eight provincials were chosen to superintend the
preachers in the eight provinces of Spain, France Lombardy,
Romagna, Provence, Germany, Hungary and England.&nbsp; Presently
after this, August 26, 1221, Dominic died in the 51st year of his
age. <a name="citation512"></a><a href="#footnote512"
class="citation">[512]</a>&nbsp; Lest his order should be hurt by
the maxims of worldly prudence, he forbad, under the curse of God
and his own, the introduction of temporal possessions into the
order.&nbsp; The second year after his death he was
<i>canonized</i>, and so reached the very summit of
ecclesiastical dignity and fame.</p>
<p>These preaching friars, as we are told, were so zealous at the
first, and considered preaching as so essential to their
institution, that they were not satisfied if they did not exhort
some, at least one person, every day.</p>
<p><a name="page513"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 513</span>Each
of them carried with him a copy of the gospel of Matthew, and of
the seven canonical epistles, according to the express order of
Dominic: but that could redound to the credit of neither him nor
them, while they lived in open violation of the most important
precepts and the very spirit of those sacred writings.&nbsp; Had
they made them, indeed, the ground of their religion, and the
rule or guide of their lives, they would have been a blessing to
the world in their day, and their memory would have been revered
by all good men, to the latest posterity.&nbsp; But they
preferred their own rule to that of the New Testament, and the
persecuting and murderous ferocity of Dominic to the forbearance
and meekness of Christ, and so became the oppressors instead of
the benefactors of their species.&nbsp; In short we know not of
any material benefit which the former inhabitants of this town
derived from the Clough Lane convent, <a
name="citation513"></a><a href="#footnote513"
class="citation">[513]</a> or the incessant labours of its
preaching friars.&nbsp; The reader however, on this point, as
well as all others, must judge for himself.</p>

<p class="gutsumm"><i>Account of the Convent of the Austin
Friars</i>, <i>or Hermits of the order of St. Augustin</i>, <i>in
Hogman&rsquo;s Lane</i>, <i>or Hopman&rsquo;s Way</i>, <i>now St.
Austin&rsquo;s Street</i>, <i>with a sketch of that religious
order</i>.</p>
<p>This house must have been once a large, respectable, <a
name="page514"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 514</span>and stately
edifice, inferior to none, and in some respects superior to most,
and probably to all others in this town; especially in point of
fitness for the accommodation of illustrious personages, or those
of princely dignity, who might happen to come this way.&nbsp; It
accordingly became the abode, or place of residence of the king
and queen, the prince of Wales, the king&rsquo;s mother, and the
royal retinue, during their visit or stay here in 1498.&nbsp; Had
there been any other house then in the town better adapted for
their reception, it would, no doubt, have been chosen in
preference, or instead of this, on so unusual and important an
occasion.&nbsp; But however commodious, respectable, or stately a
structure, this Augustinian convent then was, it has long ago
disappeared, and not a stone of it has been left upon
another.&nbsp; A gateway, or the arch of a gateway, filled up
with brick, but once, perhaps, the principal entrance into the
hallowed premises, is all that now remains, or is recognised as
having ever belonged to it.&nbsp; Thus our firmest fabrics,
though they may endure for ages, are doomed to perish like the
very mortals by whose hands they were constructed.</p>
<p>Parkin says that the Augustin friars settled herein the
beginning of Edward the First&rsquo;s reign, as appears by a writ
<i>Ad quod damnum</i>, for a messuage in Lynn, granted by
Margaret de Southmere to them.&mdash;Inquis. 22. Ed. I. in turri
Lond. N&deg;. 112.&nbsp; He also adds, that they had a patent
granted them by Edward II. in his 4th year, for purchasing, of
Thomas Lexham, one messuage contiguous and adjoining, for the
enlargement <a name="page515"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
515</span>of their manse or house.&mdash;Pat. 4th. Ed. II. pt. 2.
m. 14.&mdash;He further says, that Licence was granted by Ed.
III. to Thomas Drew, William Bitering, John de Couteshale, and
John Drew of Lenn Bishop, that they might give and assign five
messuages in Lenne, adjoining to the manse of the prior and
brethren of hermits of the order of St. Augustin of Lenn, to the
said prior, &amp;c. for the enlargement of their manse, on
condition that the reverend father, Thomas, bishop of Norwich, of
whom the said messuages are held, will grant his licence to the
said prior, &amp;c.&nbsp; And the said king gave licence to
Robert de Cokesford, Agnes his wife, and to Richard de Houton and
Alice his wife, that they may give one messuage in Lynn, (not
held of us, as appears by the inquisition of Roger de Wolfreton,
escheator of Norfolk) to the bishop and his successors, on the
same condition of granting licence to the prior, &amp;c. of
receiving the said five messuages of Thomas Drew,
&amp;c.&mdash;Teste Rege, dated at Westminster, 6 May, 38. Edw.
III.&mdash;The bishop&rsquo;s licence was soon after obtained,
dated 1 July following.</p>
<p>In the 6th of Richard II. these friars had a patent for a
certain aqueduct, to be made by them from Gaywode.&mdash;In the
7th Henry IV. they had a patent to enlarge their manses and in
the 1st Henry V. a patent for certain messuages granted to
them.&nbsp; For each of these particulars Parkin refers to his
authorities; the insertion of which here seems needless.&mdash;He
also asserts on the authorities of Bale and Holinshed, that in
the last mentioned reign, William Wellys, or Wallys, was <a
name="page516"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 516</span>a monk
here, a learned man, and general of the order, who wrote many
books, (which he does not name,) and died in 1421.&mdash;It seems
therefore that learning was not entirely neglected here among our
Austin friars, and that they had at least one learned man in
their fraternity.</p>
<p>Our author further informs us, &ldquo;that this house was
surrendered 30th Sept. 1539, 30th of Henry VIII. by the prior and
4 brethren:&rdquo; if so they must have been then reduced below
their wonted number.&nbsp; But 4 brethren is probably a mistake
for 14, which is the number given by Burnet in his history of the
reformation, and other authorities.&mdash;About 6 years after the
above date, this house was granted to John Ayre, who conveyed it
to a priest, who sold it to Shavington, a bastard, who by will
gave it to &mdash; Waters, who dying without issue it reverted to
Shavington&rsquo;s heir; John Ditefield afterwards had it, and
his son John gave it in marriage to Thomasine his sister, married
to Christopher Puchering, brother to the lord keeper of that
name, and they sold it to John Lease, who pulled it down, and
sold the stones and the ground to divers persons: so that it
seems to have stood a good while after the dissolution, and
passed through a great many hands.&mdash;Its site is at present
partly the property of Martin Folkes Rishton, Esq. Joseph
Lawrence Esq. and Mr. Thomas Marshall.&nbsp; For the most part it
is now garden ground.</p>
<p>It was to this very order of mendicants, the Austin friars, or
monks, or Augustinian Eremites, as they are sometimes called,
that the famous Martin Luther belonged <a
name="page517"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 517</span>before he
quitted the church of Rome, and when he began to oppose the papal
corruptions: and it is supposed not to have been then quite so
bad or depraved, as some of the other mendicant orders,
particularly the Dominicans and Franciscans.&nbsp; However that
was, it was, no doubt, bad enough, even in the opinion of Luther
himself, for he soon withdrew from it, as well as from all manner
of connection with the Romish church.&nbsp; It is to be wished it
could also be said, that he and all other descriptions of
protestants took special care when they renounced popery, to
retain none of its enslaving and persecuting spirit.&nbsp; Most
of them, however, quite forgot to do that, and so retained and
cherished in their bosoms the very worst part of the religion
they had renounced.</p>
<p>As to the religious order now under consideration, the
<i>Austin friars</i>, or <i>Hermits of St. Augustin</i>, we are
told that they had for their founder, pope <i>Alexander IV.</i>
who, observing that the <i>Hermits</i> were divided into several
societies, some of which followed the maxims of the famous
<i>William</i>, others the rule of <i>St. Augustin</i>, while
others again were distinguished by different denominations,
formed the project of uniting them all into one religious order,
and subjecting them to the same rule of discipline, even that
which bears the name of <i>St. Augustin</i>.&nbsp; This project,
we are told, was put in execution in 1256: <a
name="citation517"></a><a href="#footnote517"
class="citation">[517]</a> so that this order is somewhat
younger, or of later origin than any of the other orders of
mendicants; though not much later than the two preceding <a
name="page518"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 518</span>ones, for
all the three sprung up within the same century.&mdash;What good
or benefit the former inhabitants of Lynn might derive from the
erection of this convent in their town, or from the exertions of
the Austin Friars among them, is a question which the present
writer is not fully prepared to answer.&nbsp; The reader, as in
the former cases, is left to think and judge for himself, as he
has an undoubted right to do.&nbsp; But whatever good or ill,
advantage or disadvantage, benefit or detriment might accrue to
the inhabitants from the residence of the said four orders of
friars among them, their convents, unquestionably, must have
contributed not a little to give additional grandeur and
respectability to the appearance of the town.&nbsp; Four large
and stately monasteries, with their lofty towers, ranged along
the whole town from south to north, must have given Lynn an
appearance, especially from the country, very different, and far
superior to what it can boast of at present.&nbsp; In short, we
may safely say, that it must have appeared before the
reformation, from the circumstances just alluded to, as a place
of at least double the size and double the consequence that it
has done since that period.&nbsp; After all, it is not meant here
to disparage the reformation, or to suggest that it did not prove
beneficial to Lynn, as well as to the kingdom at large.&mdash;It
is only meant to assert, that this town, from the great size and
number of its monasteries and other religious houses, must have
made a very different, and far more splendid appearance before
the reformation, than it has done since.&nbsp; But we will here
drop the subject, and conclude the present section.</p>
<h4><a name="page519"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

<p class="gutsumm"><i>Of the Friars de Penitentia</i>, <i>or
brothers of repentance</i>, <i>and their Convent&mdash;also the
College of Priests&mdash;with the Hospital and Church of St. John
in this town</i>.</p>
<p>It seems remarkable that out of 1148 monasteries and religious
houses, seized upon by the sovereign and suppressed at the
general dissolution, no less than 79 were in Norfolk, and 10 of
them in this town alone; which must be a large proportion of
those of the county, and still larger of those of the whole
kingdom.&nbsp; Norfolk was also distinguished, and is so still,
for its number of parishes, exceeding that of any other county,
even of Yorkshire, though four times its size.&nbsp; This
superabundance of parishes and convents, &amp;c. seems to
indicate that its inhabitants were formerly of an uncommonly
devout and religious, or at least superstitious and sanctimonious
cast: which character may be supposed to have belonged to the
people of Lynn as much as to any of the rest.&nbsp; At present a
very large proportion of the inhabitants of Norfolk, especially
in country places, are exceedingly ignorant, boorish and
heathenish.&nbsp; Nor do the generality of the established clergy
appear to give themselves the least concern about this, or
express any serious desire to promote the conversion and
civilization of their poor neighbours.&nbsp; The dissenters, and
particularly those of them called Methodists, have done already
far more in this way than the whole body of the national or
parochial priesthood: and they are continually enlarging their
scale of operation, and extending their labours, with great
effect, to the most retired and obscure <a
name="page520"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 520</span>places,
where the divine power of the Gospel and the happy influence of
its moral precepts were hardly ever before felt or
experienced.</p>
<p>Of the ten houses suppressed in this town at the general
dissolution, one is said to belong to <i>the friars de
Penitentia</i>.&nbsp; This religious order appears to have sprang
up in the same century with the proceeding ones; for we are told
that it was instituted in 1221, by the famous <i>St. Anthony of
Padua</i>, who was born at Lisbon, in 1195, and whose original
name was <i>Ferrand</i>.&nbsp; After going through his studies
with reputation, he entered into a monastery of canons regular,
of the order of St. Austin, where he continued two years; when,
for the sake of greater solitude, he retired with the leave of
his superior to Coimbra, where he distinguished himself by his
exposition of the scriptures.&nbsp; At this time St. Francis was
living, and some of his order having suffered martyrdom, in
consequence of undertaking to preach to the Mahometans in Africa,
they were so much celebrated on that account, that it excited in
Ferrand, as well as many others, an ardent desire to follow their
example, though they should share the same fate.&nbsp; With the
leave of his superior, he therefore joined this new society; and
entering one of their monasteries, called that of <i>St.
Anthony</i>, he took their habit and assumed their name.</p>
<p>Presently after this, his zeal actually carried him to Africa;
but he was obliged to return, in consequence of a disease with
which he was seized upon the coast; but <a
name="page521"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 521</span>was driven
by a tempest to Sicily, where hearing of a general chapter of his
order being to be held at Assisi in Italy, he repaired to
it.&nbsp; Tho&rsquo; he was then little known, the provincial of
his order was so much pleased with his appearance, that he took
him with him, and placed him in a convent called <i>the mount of
St. Paul</i>.&nbsp; After some months, his superiors procured him
holy orders, and sent him, together with some other priests, to
Forli, where he distinguished himself by his preaching.&nbsp;
Being greatly concerned at the progress of heresy then in the
northern parts of Italy, in order the better to prepare himself
for encountering the heretics, he went through a course of
theology at Vercelli, under a famous doctor there; but he soon
surpassed him in knowledge, and was thought equal to any
undertaking.</p>
<p>Being sent by his superiors to undertake the office of
guardian to Limiges in France, in order to the conversion of the
heretics in that place, it happened at one time, that his
business as a preacher required him to be in one place, and his
office of guardian in another: and this was the occasion of the
first of the many miracles that his historian ascribes to him,
and it was of a very singular kind: for it is asserted that he
was actually in both places at the same time.&nbsp; After an
earnest prayer for this purpose, he without leaving the pulpit in
which he was preaching on a Good Friday, appeared in the choir,
and sung the lesson which was his part of the service
there.&nbsp; At Montpellier also, he once preached in the dome at
the same time that he was singing <a name="page522"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 522</span>hallelujah in the choir of the
church.&nbsp; After this his whole life seems to have consisted
of little more than a series of miracles, and many of them of
quite an original and extraordinary kind; so that it must have
required much ingenuity to devise them. <a
name="citation522"></a><a href="#footnote522"
class="citation">[522]</a>&mdash;Some of them may be here
inserted by way of sample, and to enable the reader to judge of
the probable effect or consequence of the settlement of
Anthony&rsquo;s disciples, <i>the friars de Penitentia</i>, in
this town.</p>
<p>When Anthony was at one time preaching in a temporary
building, constructed of wood, he apprised his audience that the
devil was about to terrify and hurt them, but that no harm would
eventually happen to any of them.&nbsp; Accordingly while he was
preaching, the devil untied the ropes by which the boards were
held together, so that the whole erection came down.&nbsp; But
when it might have been expected that many of the persons
assembled would have been crushed to death, or at least maimed,
not one of them was found to have received the smallest
hurt!&mdash;Another time a pious woman, much attached to Anthony,
who had a son of a reprobate character, when she was attending
one of his sermons the devil came in the form of a courier, and
delivering a letter informed her that her son was dead.&nbsp;
This news threw her, and the audience in general, into such
disorder, that the congregation was breaking up; when Anthony
cried out that the news was not true, that it was the devil that
had brought it, and that the young man was alive, as they would
soon be convinced; accordingly, <a name="page523"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 523</span>while he was speaking he entered the
place, and the devil absconded.</p>
<p>Something more extraordinary than any of the preceding
miracles, was exhibited at Rome.&nbsp; For being required by the
pope to preach to a congregation, consisting of people of very
different countries, assembled for a crusade, they all heard him
speak in their different languages, though he spoke in Italian
only.&mdash;But the astonishing miracle exhibited at Rimini,
contributed more to the fame of Anthony than all his other
miracles.&nbsp; Preaching in that city, which abounded with
heretics, and the people refusing to hear him, he went to the sea
side, followed by a great crowd; when, the sea being remarkably
calm, he addressed himself to the fishes; saying, &ldquo;Since
men will not hear me, come you and hearken to what God will tell
you by me.&rdquo;&nbsp; Immediately on this the sea was covered
with the heads of fishes, which with open mouths fixed their eyes
on him; and notwithstanding their hostility to each other, they
mildly and humbly (as it is said) without moving their fins, or
making the least motion in the water, attended to him.&nbsp;
After a discourse of some length, he exhorted them to praise God;
and since they could not do it in words shew some visible signs
of reverence.&nbsp; On this they all bowed their heads, moving
them very gently, and with gestures expressive of humility and
devotion, acknowledged their obligation to God, and signified
their apt probation of what had been addressed to them.&nbsp; The
spectators greatly amazed (and well they might: for who could
avoid it?) looked sometimes on the fishes, and <a
name="page524"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 524</span>sometimes
on the preacher; and being reproved by him for their infidelity,
thus upbraided by the mute fishes, they fell on their knees,
asking his pardon, and promising to live and die in the catholic
faith.&nbsp; He then pronounced a blessing, both on the men and
the fishes, and they departed with great joy. <a
name="citation524"></a><a href="#footnote524"
class="citation">[524]</a></p>
<p>Such were some of the numerous miracles which Anthony is said
to have worked in his lifetime, exclusive of others said to have
been wrought afterwards at his grave, and which were perhaps no
fewer.&nbsp; Of those who have heard of these mighty and
wonderful works of Anthony, the far greater part in all ages,
even to the present day, have believed the report, and admitted
the reality of the miracles: which, however, will not establish
the fact, that they were actually performed, any more than the
faith of the mahometans in the alleged miracles of their
pretended prophet will establish that fact, or prove that the
miracles ascribed to him did really take place.&nbsp; In each
case we have a sad specimen of that easy and miserable credulity
by which poor human nature has often most wretchedly disgraced
herself, and unintentionally aided the cause and triumphs of
imposture.&nbsp; Nor will it follow from the abundance of false
miracles that have been heard of, or because the world has been
so often imposed upon by them, that there never have been any
real ones; on the contrary, all counterfeits seem invariably to
imply the existence of what is real and genuine; and that, it is
presumed, may be proved to be the case here.&nbsp; But this is
not a place to enter largely upon this subject.</p>
<p><a name="page525"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
525</span>Anthony had been some years among the Franciscans
before he instituted the order <i>de Penitantia</i>, which was in
1221, when he also fixed at Padua, where he sometimes preached in
the open air to 30,000 persons, who came to hear him from all the
neighbouring towns.&nbsp; His discourses, it is said, had a
wonderful effect in converting prostitutes, delivering prisoners,
reconciling enemies, procuring restitution of usury, remission of
debts, &amp;c.&nbsp; He was indefatigable, and preached every
day.&nbsp; Many persons expressing a desire to embrace the order,
he was unwilling to dissolve so many regular marriages, and
dispeople the country: he therefore gave them a rule, according
to which they might serve God in a similar manner in their
houses, living in some measure like monks, but without
austerity.&mdash;This is the substance of what we have learnt
about this order.&nbsp; He died in the year above mentioned at
the age of 36, and was canonized the next year.&nbsp; We are told
that he was ten years among the Franciscans, if indeed it can be
said that he afterwards properly quitted them for the friars
<i>de Penitentia</i> are accounted a 3rd order of Franciscans. <a
name="citation525a"></a><a href="#footnote525a"
class="citation">[525a]</a>&nbsp; We are told that they settled
at Lynn before the 5th of Edward I. and that their house here was
dissolved by Henry VIII. <a name="citation525b"></a><a
href="#footnote525b" class="citation">[525b]</a> but where it
stood cannot now be ascertained.&nbsp; Parkin seemed inclined to
indentify it with the well known convent of the Grey Friars, but
that idea or supposition seems not at all admissible, as our
apparently most accurate accounts of the religious houses
dissolved here represent that of the friars of this order as
quite distinct from the said convent, <a name="page526"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 526</span>and this seems corroborated by
Parkin&rsquo;s own assertion, that &ldquo;in 1307, Roger Flegg
was vicar general of the order of friars de Penitentia in England
at Lenne.&rdquo; <a name="citation526a"></a><a
href="#footnote526a" class="citation">[526a]</a>&nbsp; From the
peculiar constitution of this order it seems rather probable that
its houses or convents might be neither so large nor yet so
numerous as those of most of the other orders.&nbsp; As that at
Lynn might be but small, there may not be much reason to wonder
that its site is not now discoverable; that being also the case
with some others of our smaller religious houses.&mdash;With all
its profound and extravagant reverence for its founder, St.
Anthony, and its unlimited credulity, or faith in his pretended
miracles, this does not appear to be the worst of the popish
orders, but rather one of the better sort of them, as it seemed
earnestly to set its face against many of the prevailing vices of
the times, which must have somewhat checked the progress of
immorality and licentiousness.&mdash;These friars might therefore
be of some use here: but if they were so, and did some good, in
partially checking the progress of vice and immorality, is it not
also to be feared, on the other hand, that they did no less, or
rather much more harm, in checking likewise the progress of
virtue and true religion, and promoting to the utmost of their
power an intolerant, persecuting, and antichristian spirit? <a
name="citation526b"></a><a href="#footnote526b"
class="citation">[526b]</a>&nbsp; That such was really the fact
<a name="page527"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 527</span>seems
unquestionable; so that these friars had little room to boast of
their good doings.&nbsp; But we will now quit them, and proceed
to</p>
<p><i>The</i> <span class="smcap">College</span>.&nbsp; This
edifice stands near the Town Hall, and is now inhabited by Mr.
<i>Toosey</i>, a respectable merchant.&nbsp; It is by far the
most entire, and best preserved of all the religious houses that
were here dissolved; and were popery again to become predominant
among us, this fabrick might be very easily converted or restored
to its original use.&mdash;Parkin gives of it a very odd and
confused account, as if it had been a part of the Priory, though
somewhat detached from it&mdash;&ldquo;The cell, or college of
priests (says he) was near the Guildhall, <a
name="page528"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 528</span>and the
prior&rsquo;s house was somewhat remote from it, by St.
Margaret&rsquo;s Church.&rdquo;&nbsp; It does not seem, however,
that it had in fact any connection with the said priory: and it
is certainly a place of much later erection; probably by no less
than 3 or 400 years.&mdash;Mackerell also takes some slight
notice of it, and says, &ldquo;Not far from the church was a
certain college, founded by Mr. <i>Thomas Thorisby</i>, as by the
inscription carved upon the door still remain . . .&nbsp;
<i>Magistri</i> Thome Thorisby, <i>Fundatoris hujus
loci</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; This Thomas Thorisby, the munificent
founder of this college, was one of the great men of Lynn in the
latter part of the 15th century, and for sometime after, as
appears from our lists of Mayors, among whom his name occurs
three different times; 1st in 1477, again in 1482, and lastly in
1502.&nbsp; That he was a magistrate of a serious and religious
character, seems to admit of no doubt; but how many of his
successors, including those of the present day, have thought the
better of him for that, is a question that appears involved in no
small uncertainty.&nbsp; The College is said to have been founded
about the year 1500, and it was dissolved about 30 years after,
so that it was not long appropriated to the use for which it was
designed by the founder.&nbsp; It does not appear to whom it went
at the dissolution, nor do we know through how many hands, or how
many different families it has passed, from that to the present
time.&nbsp; Latterly, and for many years, it has been the
residence successively of some of our principal mercantile
families, without any material change in its external
appearance.&nbsp; Of its original constitution we have not
obtained any <a name="page529"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
529</span>particular information, and the above being the
substance of what we have learnt concerning it, our account of it
must be here closed.</p>
<p>Another House, suppressed here at the general dissolution, was
St. John&rsquo;s Hospital: of which the information we have been
able to obtain is very imperfect and scanty.&nbsp; Its very site,
like that of the friars de Penitentia, seems no longer
discoverable; and yet it was evidently, in its day, a place of
some note and consequence here, and had a chapel, or church, as
it is usually called, attached to it.&nbsp; <i>Fox</i>, the
martyrologist, mentions St. John&rsquo;s church, or the church of
the Hospital of St. John, in this town, as one of the places
where the memorable <i>Sir William Sautre</i>, parish priest of
St. Margaret&rsquo;s, when taken up for heresy in the reign of
Henry IV. was obliged to read his recantation.&nbsp;
<i>Parkin</i> takes very little notice of it, except quoting what
Fox had said: and the same is the case with <i>Mackerell</i>,
with this slight difference, that he in one place hazards a
conjecture, that the site of this church was the same with that
of the old grammar school, which was taken down some years
ago.&nbsp; But if the church stood there, the hospital itself
must also, in all probability, have stood close by, if not
contiguous; and that seems not very likely, in so confined a
situation.&nbsp; We know of no existing record that any way
corroborates this conjecture, unless it be a hint in our tables
of memorable events, &ldquo;That in the year 1506, St.
Margaret&rsquo;s church was suspended, and the christenings were
performed <a name="page530"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
530</span>in the charnel belonging to St. John&rsquo;s
chapel:&rdquo; but it seems too vague and obscure to establish
the point.&nbsp; It is indeed very clear and certain that there
did exist here formerly the Hospital and church of St. John, and
that they were suppressed at the general dissolution, but as we
know no more about them, we must here dismiss the subject.</p>

<p class="gutsumm"><i>Account of St. Mary Magdalen&rsquo;s
Hospital</i>, <i>the Lazar Houses</i>, <i>St. Lawrence&rsquo;s
Hospital</i>, <i>&amp;c.</i></p>
<p>The Hospital of St. Mary Magdalen was one of the most ancient
of those religious houses that were suppressed here by Henry
VIII.&nbsp; It is said to have been founded by Petrus Capellanus,
in the reign of King Stephen, in honour of St. Mary
Magdalen.&nbsp; It consisted of a prior and twelve brethren and
sisters; of whom ten, including the prior were sound, and three
unsound, or leprous; some ecclesiastical, and some secular; who
were bound to perform rites and prayers for the souls of certain
men who had departed this life, <i>viz.</i> for the soul of
Petrus Capellanus their founder, the souls of popes, bishops,
abbots, priors, kings, queens, and others, their benefactors; as
appears by their ancient book of <i>obiits</i> and
<i>Orisons</i>, and by the ancient instrument of articles, which
the brethren and sisters were bound to observe: and all, or most
of the lands given to <a name="page531"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 531</span>the said hospital were for the
maintaining of prayers for the dead, as appears by divers deeds
and charters, without date, of the first donations of those
lands. <a name="citation531"></a><a href="#footnote531"
class="citation">[531]</a></p>
<p>In Mr. Kings MS. Volume there is a larger account of this
ancient hospital than has been given by Mackerell and
Parkin.&nbsp; We have there the ancient instrument of articles,
or the fundamental rules of the fraternity, in Latin, under XVIII
heads: annexed to which is the following account&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;This Instrument of Articles was made in the
year that Petrus Capellanus died [<span
class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 1174.] and himself consented, with
the two archbishops, for ordaining the same.&rdquo;&mdash;Then
follows what has been given by Mackerell, that &ldquo;this
ancient hospital continued in a prosperous state from its first
foundation about 400 years.&nbsp; But after the statute of 1st
Edward VI. was made, for dissolving all colleges, chauntries
fraternities, &amp;c. this, with the lands &amp;c. came to, and
were invested in the crown, by the said statute.&nbsp; The
fraternity, however, was not then broke up or dispersed, and
might, perhaps, have been still continued, but for the breaking
out of what is called Kett&rsquo;s rebellion.&nbsp; A party of
the rebels were encamped at Rising: and they attacked Lynn, in
hopes of surprising it, but being repulsed and disappointed,
they, on their return, fell upon this hospital, which they
violently entered, and not only robbed the poor people there, and
expelled them out of the house, but took away all their common
stock, and rased their chapel and most part of the buildings
there down to the ground: by means of which <a
name="page532"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 532</span>barbarous
usage, the said hospital was so impoverished, wasted, and
spoiled, that from thence forward it was quite destitute of
brethren and sisters, and utterly relinquished, saving that the
mayor and burgesses of Lynn maintained some poor people there,
and endeavoured to uphold the said ancient hospital, out of their
charitable disposition, for the purposes aforesaid.&rdquo; <a
name="citation532"></a><a href="#footnote532"
class="citation">[532]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Nevertheless (says the author of the MS. account) some
covetous persons, taking advantage of the depressed state of the
said hospital, procured divers letters patents of concealment,
from the crown; some of the site of the same, and some of other
parcels of the lands and possessions belonging to the said
hospital, intending to convert them to their own private
lucre.&nbsp; But the said mayor and burgesses, (still having a
great care that the said lands and possessions should be
preserved for charitable uses) did purchase of some of the
concealers the site of the said hospital, and a great part of the
lands thereunto belonging, and at their great costs and charges
supported and defended the same against all other concealers and
their agents, purposing always to erect anew the said hospital,
and employ the revenues thereof for the sustentation of poor
people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But finding both by the advice of the king&rsquo;s
councill [counsel] and their own, that all the said patents of
concealment were defective and utterly void in law, through many
imperfections therein, and that (notwithstanding the said
patents) the scite of the said hospital and the <a
name="page533"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 533</span>lands and
possessions thereof still remained in the crown&mdash;therefore
they made humble suit to the king&rsquo;s majesty [James I.] for
a grant thereof, and, of his Highness&rsquo; gracious favour and
pious inclination to works of charity, they obtained Letters
Patents of grant unto the mayor and aldermen, as well of the
scite of the said hospital, as also of the lands, &amp;c.
thereunto belonging, who by the same are created governors
thereof, and made a body corporate for the defence and
maintenance of the said hospital new founded by his
majestie.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[An abridgement of those Letters Patents, transcribed from the
Latin copy, is here subjoined, and is as follows.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;JAMES by the grace of God king of England,
&amp;c. to all to whom these Letters shall come, greeting,
&amp;c.&mdash;Whereas a certain ancient Hospital or Almshouse was
founded and erected in Gaywood, called the House or Hospital of
St. Mary Magdalen&mdash;And whereas divers lands, tenements, and
hereditaments, were given and granted for the maintenance and
relief of divers poor and needy men and women therein for
ever&mdash;And we being informed, that certain evil minded men,
covetously pursuing their own private lucre, have endeavoured
utterly to demolish the state of the said Hospital, pretending
some defect in the foundation thereof, or that the same have been
dissolved&mdash;We favouring the sustentation of the poor, and
such like charitable deeds, do of our special grace, for us, our
heirs and successors, grant all that right, title, &amp;c. which
we have or might have in the premises, fully and graciously to be
conferred and extended towards the establishment of the said
Hospital, <a name="page534"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
534</span>for poor and infirm men and women to dwell therein: and
for the causes aforesaid the same shall for ever hereafter be
called by the name of The Hospital of St. Mary Magdalen, of the
foundation of king James, consisting of a Master and Warden and
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, or 5 poor needy men and women, who shall likewise
be called, The Brethren and Sisters of the said Hospital, from
henceforth for ever.&mdash;And for the more effectual performance
of this our grant on our part, We have chosen nominated and
appointed our well beloved Peter Tudman to be the first and
present warden, or master of the said hospital, and to continue
in the said office for and during his natural life, unless for
some default, trespass, misdemeanor, &amp;c. omitted or committed
by him, contrary to the constitutions or ordinances hereafter to
be made and ordained, he shall be from thence removed.&mdash;And
moreover out of our own especial grace, certain knowledge, and
mere motion, We have also chosen, nominated, &amp;c. our well
beloved John Tilney and Avis his wife, Isabel wife of the said
Peter Tudman, John Pillow, Alice Briggs, and William Mason, to be
the first and present brethren and sisters of the said hospital,
there to be relieved and maintained during their natural lives,
unless for some fault or misdemeanor they shall from thence be
removed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that this our pious and charitable intention may
take the better effect, and that the lands, tenements, goods and
chattels, and hereditaments, towards the maintenance of the said
hospital and the warden or master, and the poor brethren and
sisters &amp;c. may the more <a name="page535"></a><span

enjoyed, possessed and disposed, We will, and by these Letters
Patents for us our heirs and successors of our like special grace
&amp;c. do grant ordain and constitute that the Mayor of our
Burgh of King&rsquo;s Lynn that now is, or hereafter shall be,
and all the aldermen that now are or hereafter shall be, shall,
from henceforth forever be our Body corporate and politique, in
deed, fact, and name, by the title of The Governors of the lands,
tenements, revenues, possessions, and hereditaments of the
Hospital of St. Mary Magdalen upon the Cawsey between Lynn regis
and Gaywood, of the foundation of James king of England,
&amp;c.&mdash;And by the said name of Governors, &amp;c. to be
always hereafter so called, termed, and nominated, for ever: and
by the same to have perpetual succession, and to be both able and
capable in law to obtain, receive, have, and possess the manors,
lands, tenements, meadows, pastures, feedings, rents, reversions,
remainders, and all other hereditaments whatsoever, to them and
their successors for ever, as well from us our heirs, &amp;c. as
from any person or persons whatsoever; as also all goods and
chattels for the maintenance and relief of the said hospital, the
warden or master, and the poor brethren and sisters which shall,
from time to time, live and be sustained therein.&mdash;And we do
likewise by these presents for us and our heirs &amp;c. grant
unto them and their successors to have a common seal for all
matters and businesses concerning the said hospital
&amp;c.&mdash;And that they by the name aforesaid may answer and
be answered in any of his <a name="page536"></a><span

within this kingdom of England.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we will that whensoever it shall happen, that the
said master or any of the said 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, or 5 of the
brethren shall die or be removed, it shall and may be lawful for
the said governors (whereof the mayor to be always one) within 20
days after, to choose another in their room&mdash;And we will and
grant that the said Warden or Master and his successors shall
take his corporal oath on the evangelists for the due performance
of his office, before the mayor for the time being, in the
Guildhall of the said Burgh&mdash;And we will and grant that the
said governors, or the greatest part of them (whereof the mayor
to be always one) and their successors with the assent and
consent of the bishop of Norwich for the time being, may make and
constitute such and so many good and wholesome statutes, laws,
&amp;c. in writing, as well concerning the celebration of divine
service every day in the said hospital to the honour of God, as
for the government, election, expulsion, punishment and direction
of the said master and poor there, and also concerning their
stipends, salaries, liveries, habits, and all other necessaries
whatsoever, as also concerning the ordinary, preservation, and
disposing of all the lands, tenements &amp;c.&mdash;And also may
give and grant to the master and poor there, such useful things
as they shall think fit: and may revoke, change, determine,
augment, alter, and make new the same as they think most
convenient; which said statutes, laws, and ordinances, to be made
and constituted as aforesaid we straitly charge <a

to be kept inviolable, from time to time for ever, yet so as the
same be not contrary to the laws and statutes of this kingdom of
England.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And further for the continual relief and sustentation
of the said hospital we have given and granted, and by these
presents do give and grant to the said governors all the
lordships, manors, messuages, lands, meadows, pastures,

<p style="text-align: right"><i>Per Breve de privato
sigillo</i>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;After the grant aforesaid, the mayor and
aldermen endeavoured by all fair means, to prevail with the
concealers and usurpers of the many lands, &amp;c. to yield and
deliver up the quiet possession thereof to them, the said
governors, without suit in law; but not able to succeed therein,
they thereupon exhibited a bill of complaints into [in] the High
Court of Chancery, against those who withheld the same, and had
likewise gotten into their hands sundry Deeds, Evidences,
Writings, Charters, Copies of Court Rolls, and Muniments,
concerning the said Hospital, for about thirty years before the
king&rsquo;s majesty&rsquo;s Letters Patents: whose names are as
follow, viz. Sir Philip Woodhouse; Thomas Thoresbie Esq.; Henry
Bastard, Gent.; Henry Baker, Gent.; Thomas Baxter; Robert
Anderson; Richard Cross; Jefferie Pell; Robert Large; Robert
Trollop; William <a name="page541"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
541</span>Simpson, clerk; Robert Say, junr; Robert Spence, Gent.;
Robert Webster; William Collis, als Glover:&mdash;Who having
given in their several answers to the said bill, an order was
made by the court, that the complainants should set down in
writing, the particular lands and fold courses by them claimed,
together with the evidences for proof thereof, that the same
belonged to the said hospital, and how much the defendants have
of those lands in their several possessions, &amp;c. which they
did as followeth&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[The lands, &amp;c. in question, are then particularly
specified and described, being chiefly in East and West Lexham,
and Dunham and Gaywood.&nbsp; They are denominated
&ldquo;<i>Lands of the Lepers</i>, or Spittle lands, pertaining
to the brethren and sisters of the House, <i>called</i> <span
class="smcap">The Spittle</span>, upon the cawsey between Lynn
and Gaywood&rdquo;&mdash;the whole amounting to 305
acres&mdash;The complainants having thus specified their claims,
the suit went on.]</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;After divers hearings on both sides, in the
high court of Chancery, for about four years together, the
plaintiffs being prepared to move the lord chancellor with all
speed for a decree, and for their costs and damages, Sir Philip
Woodhouse defendant, (who had most of the lands, &amp;c. in his
hands,) solicited and intreated Sir H. Hobart, knt. and bart.
Lord chief justice of the Common Pleas, to hear and determine the
cause between them, which being consented to by the plaintiffs,
his lordship gave his opinion, that the plaintiffs had right to
all the lands and foldcourses, in the boundary before mentioned,
in such manner as they have been claimed <a
name="page542"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 542</span>by them,
excepting the messuage Warm, and 5 acres thereunto
adjoining.&nbsp; And therefore to prevent further suit and
expences on both sides, his lordship advised Sir Ph. Woodhouse to
suffer that which he could not contradict, viz. that a decree
should pass of all the lands and foldcourses (except as before
excepted) for the plaintiffs, as in law and equity it ought to
be: but withal mediated and intreated the counsel of the
plaintiffs, in behalf of the said Sir Ph. that in regard so much
of the lands and fold courses as were in the possession of Sir
Philip, did lye so intermixed with his lands, it would be a great
annoyance to him, and little profit to the plaintiffs, if the
same were severed, that therefore it would please the
plaintiff&rsquo;s counsel to consent that the plaintiffs, after
the decree passed, should make a lease to him of the premises
aforesaid for 99 years, at the yearly rent of 16<i>l.</i> viz.
their foldcourses at East Lexham, being in his possession for
10<i>l.</i> per annum, and all their grounds in West Lexham and
great Dunham, also in his possession at 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> for
every acre per annum, and that the said Sir Philip Woodhouse
should be discharged of all the rents, issues, and profits of the
said lands and fold courses, for the time past; whereof the
plaintiff&rsquo;s counsel agreed, and promised to procure the
same, which conclusion on both sides being made known the next
day to the lord Chancellor, by the plaintiff&rsquo;s counsel, his
lordship upon their motion, ordered and decreed their possession
of the said lands and foldcourses, unto the plaintiff&rsquo;s,
not having any relation to the said agreement made before the
Lord chief justice, as aforesaid, saving in the exception <a
name="page543"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 543</span>before
excepted, and in the omitting of damages and costs, which was
promised in the last order.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Afterwards, that it, upon the feast day of the
decollation of St. John Baptist, next following, Sir Philip
Woodhouse came to Lynn, and in the presence of John Spence, then
Mayor, Thomas Oxburgh Esq. recorder, the aldermen and the rest of
the Society then assembled in the common council house, the said
Sir Philip did bring the draught of a Lease, (perused by the Lord
Chief Justice Hobart), of the Spittle fold course of East Lexham,
and of the lands which, by the mediation of the said lord chief
justice, were to be demised by the mayor and aldermen to the said
Sir Philip, a copy of which being formally delivered to the said
mayor, &amp;c. they caused the same to be engrossed on a pair of
Indentures to that purpose, bearing date 17 May, 1615, then last
past, (upon which day the last order for the decree was made)
which Indentures were openly read, sealed, and delivered
interchangeably in the said council house the said day of the
decollation, being the election day for the succeeding
mayor.&nbsp; The said Sir Ph. sent a fat buck, and gave his
honourable promise, that he and his heirs should every year
after, during the time of his Lease, give a like fat buck to
every mayor for the time being towards their festival upon the
said day; which was, for sometime, faithfully
performed.&mdash;About a year after a Lease was granted by the
mayor, &amp;c. of all those their fold courses, foldage, and
sheep pasture in the town of great Dunham for 250 <a
name="page544"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 544</span>sheep, to
be goeing, fed, and depastured in and upon all the common, and
common pasture fields and amble grounds there, as well demesnes
as otherwise, anciently accustomed, to Sir Thomas Hogan, Henry
Bastard, Henry Barker, Thomas Baxter, Thomas Burton, for 21
years, from Lady day 1616, for 10<i>l.</i> per annum, free and
clear from all manner of quit rents and charges whatsoever.&nbsp;
Both which sheep walks, with the lands thus demised, were
anciently in Lease to the lords of the manor of East Lexham, from
the old hospital, under the yearly rent of 20<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>
as appears by two ancient rentals, [copies of which are preserved
in Mr. King&rsquo;s MS. and are here given in the note below. <a
name="citation544"></a><a href="#footnote544"
class="citation">[544]</a>]&mdash;The flocks of <a
name="page545"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 545</span>the lords
of Dunham went and were depastured in and upon the common of
Dunham&mdash;as more appeareth by an ancient survey upon oath,
both of the freehold and copyhold <a name="page546"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 546</span>tenants, made in the 4th Edward 2.
which is in the hands of Henry Bastard, Gent. now [i.e. about
1724] Lord of the manor of Great Dunham.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[A true copy of which subjoined: it is in Latin, and too long
to be inserted here, as it fills near four folio pages.]</p>
<p>After some recapitulation, by way of summary, of the above
account, the writer proceeds to treat of the then present state
of the hospital (i.e. now near a 100 years ago) and he observes
again,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;that the house was first granted by the
founder for the society of a prior and 12 men and women, called
<i>brethren and sisters</i>, by which last style and title it was
again newfounded by the aforesaid Letters Patents of K. James I.
as appears by the 6th paragraph thereof.&nbsp; But this mixture
or medley of sexes being not afterwards well and rightly approved
of, it have been since thought necessary to alter and change the
same <a name="citation546a"></a><a href="#footnote546a"
class="citation">[546a]</a> and instead thereof to establish a
<i>sisterhood only</i>, consisting of a master and eleven poor
widows, <a name="citation546b"></a><a href="#footnote546b"
class="citation">[546b]</a> who have formerly lived well and
creditably in the world; but are not usually admitted under the
age of sixty.&rdquo; <a name="citation546c"></a><a
href="#footnote546c" class="citation">[546c]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The above account was probably taken from the <i>MS. vellum
book</i>, which Parkin mentions, <a name="citation546d"></a><a
href="#footnote546d" class="citation">[546d]</a> and is supposed
still to exist among the town archives.&nbsp; It appears to have
been written in 1617, under the sanction of the then mayor,
recorder, and aldermen, and bears date on St. John&rsquo;s day
that year, when <i>John Wallis</i> was mayor, <i>Richard
Stonham</i>, mayor elect, <i>Thomas Oxburgh</i>, <a
name="page547"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 547</span>recorder,
and the following made up the remainder of the then magistrates,
or aldermen, viz. <i>Thomas Baker</i>, <i>Thomas Gibson</i>,
<i>John Spence</i>, <i>Matthew Clerk</i>, <i>John Atkyn</i>,
<i>Thomas Soame</i>, <i>John Wormell</i>, <i>Thomas Leighton</i>,
<i>William Doughty</i>, <i>William Atkyn</i>, and <i>Thomas
Gurlyn</i>.&mdash;As these seem to be the persons who had been so
active, a few years before, in recovering the lands belonging to
our Magdalen Hospital, and in promoting the reestablishment and
perpetuation of that charity, their names are worthy of being
kept in remembrance; for they certainly deserved well of their
country, and especially of the town of Lynn.&nbsp; The above
law-suit, which they so successfully carried on, appears to have
been one of the most justifiable and commendable of any that this
corporation has ever been engaged or concerned in.&nbsp; Some of
our corporation law-suits in more modern times were, it seems, of
a different character.</p>
<p>For more than thirty years after the date of king James&rsquo;
Letters Patents, and till sometime after the commencement of the
civil wars, things went on well with our Magdalen Hospital, or
Gaywood Almshouse.&nbsp; Its subsequent history, down to some
part of the last century, is given by Mackerell, as
follows&mdash;<a name="citation547"></a><a href="#footnote547"
class="citation">[547]</a></p>
<blockquote><p>In the year 1643 this hospital suffered another
dissolution, being purposely burnt down, when the Earl of
Manchester came with the parliament forces to besiege the town of
Lynn, at that time fortified, and standing out for the king,
whereby it was then become utterly dissolved for <a
name="page548"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 548</span>some
time.&mdash;But in the year 1649 the corporation being obliged to
build it anew, which is very commodiously done, as it now
appears, with two courts, <a name="citation548"></a><a
href="#footnote548" class="citation">[548]</a> a chapel, and
convenient apartments for the master, brethren, and sisters to
dwell in, it was thought fit to put up the two following
Inscriptions in proper places, to denote the occasion of this
last disaster.&nbsp; The first is over the arch, upon a square
free stone, as you enter into the second court, [and reads
thus.]</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="GutSmall">THIS
HOSPITAL WAS BURNT DOWN</span><br />
<span class="GutSmall">AT LYNN SIEGE, AND REBUILT</span><br />
<span class="GutSmall">1649, NATH. MAXEY MAYOR, AND</span><br />
<span class="GutSmall">EDW. ROBINSON</span> Alderman and
Treasurer.</p>
<p>[The other] inscription, with the arms of the corporation in a
shield over it, is engraven on a marble stone, which is affixed
over the portal next the road, [and is as follows.]</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="GutSmall">THOMAS
RIVET, MAYOR,</span><br />
<span class="GutSmall">ANNO</span> 1650. <span
class="GutSmall">E. R.</span></p>
<p>Thus after divers revolutions we now see it again erected,
established, and committed to the care and management <a
name="page549"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 549</span>of two of
the elder aldermen of the corporation, chosen and appointed
annually from among the rest of their brethren, the governors,
for that purpose, who with their joint advice and consent, ordain
rules and orders for the better guidance and direction of the
society; as may be seen fairly written in a Table hanging
constantly up in the chapel, whereby every one of the members is
obliged to be present to hear divine service daily read by the
Master, after the tolling of the bell, and not to neglect their
duty in attending, (unless upon just cause to be given to the
master) under the penalty, or mulct prescribed in the said
order.&mdash;The improvement of the lands and revenues of the
hospital have been so far advanced of late [1724] by the
provident and prudent management of the two last worthy
gentlemen, the two deputed governors thereof, that the poor have
now an addition to their former salaries, of twelve pence per
week to the master, and sixpence to each of the women, or
sisters; and it is to be hoped they may in a little time be yet
further advanced. <a name="citation549"></a><a
href="#footnote549" class="citation">[549]</a>&mdash;<a
name="page550"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 550</span>The parish
church which they are appointed to resort to on Sundays, is that
of Gaywood, in which [parish] this hospital is situated, where
they have a convenient pew, purposely provided for them to sit
in: but they may go to any other church or chapel at Lynn, or
elsewhere, when and as often as they please.&mdash;So much shall
suffice to have been spoken of this ancient hospital, being
without the walls and limits of the borough of king&rsquo;s Lynn,
though wholly depending on the corporation there. <a

class="citation">[550]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page551"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 551</span>From
the date of the above account (which seems to be brought down to
1737, when Mackerell&rsquo;s work was published) to the present
time, our information concerning the said hospital is not so
correct, particular, or ample as we could wish.&mdash;It appears
however, that divers changes have taken place from time to time
since king James&rsquo;s grant was obtained: first from a mixed
society of brethren and sisters to that of <i>sisters only</i>:
at first, it seems, these sisters were to be <i>all widows</i>,
but latterly there is said to have been a departure from that
plan, and <i>old maids</i> have been admitted, in some instances,
as well as widows; which seems not at all objectionable.&nbsp;
Changes also, of course, there have been in the weekly allowances
of the respective pensioners; but not (at least during the
present reign) in proportion to the changes in the price of the
necessaries of life.&nbsp; Half a Crown a week, which was the
allowance a hundred years ago, was to the full as good as ten or
twelve shillings a week now: and yet the poor women during any
part of this long jubilee reign (when the <i>shilling</i> has
sunk in value to <i>three-pence</i>, or a <i>groat</i>, at most)
never had above five shillings a week, till the commencement of
the present year: Nor had they been long in the receipt of even
so much as five shillings, or more than <i>four and sixpence</i>
a week, which was their stated allowance for sometime till within
these very few years.&nbsp; They must have been, therefore, till
this present year, and during most part of this long reign of
boasted prosperity and glory, in a very unenviable, miserable,
ragged, and half starving condition, although the acting governor
<a name="page552"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 552</span>was
generally a man of fortune: and a late one immensely so; but they
never fared worse than under his inspection, for his humanity or
charity did not appear to be commensurate with his wealth.&nbsp;
In short it is well for these poor pensioners that the acting
government of their house is at present in the hands of a
gentleman that seems determined to do them justice, and promote
their comfort and happiness to the utmost of his power.</p>
<p>As to the <i>four Lazar Houses</i>, or Lepers Hospitals, paid
to have been suppressed here at the general dissolution, it is
likely that one of them was attached to, or connected with our
Magdalen Hospital, for it appears to have been <i>partly</i>
founded for unsound or leprous persons.&nbsp; This therefore may
be supposed to have been one of those four suppressed
houses.&nbsp; Of the other three, one was probably at <i>West
Lynn</i>, one at <i>Cowgate</i>, and the other at
<i>Hardwick</i>.&nbsp; The disease, for the relief of those
afflicted with which these houses were founded, is said to have
been introduced, or brought from the East into this country, and
to Europe, by the madbrained crusaders, who became many ways a
terrible grievance and pest to their respective countries and
nations.&nbsp; It was a proof, certainly, of the humanity of our
countrymen, in those times, that houses were erected and endowed
for the reception and relief of persons afflicted with so
grievous and incurable a disorder.&nbsp; So little do we know
about the order, or economy, or laws of these Lazar Houses, that
we must here necessarily dismiss the subject.</p>
<p><a name="page553"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 553</span>Of
the <i>Hospital of St. Lawrence</i> very little is known, except
that it was one of the four Lazar houses and stood at Hardwick,
or <i>Herdwyk Dam</i>, as Parkin calls it.&nbsp; He says</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;that in the 11th of Edward III. Matthew
Herlewine conveyed by fine and trust to Thomas Duraunt, parson of
Clenchwarton; William Duraunt of South Lynn, and John Kervyle of
Wygenhale (along with other possessions) the advowson of the
hospital of St. Lawrence at Herdwyk Dam, together with the rents,
homages, services, &amp;c. of the master of the said hospital, of
the prior of Wirmegey, the prior of Westacre, and of John de
Lenn.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He also says, that&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;John Duraunt Esq. granted to Robert
Synkclere and Agnes his wife the hospital, or house of lepars,
with the chapel of St. Lawrence situate on the cawsey of
Hardwyke, by Lenne, with the appertenances for their lives, from
the feast of St. Michael in 27 Henry VI. paying to him, his heirs
and assigns, for every brother and sister entering into the said
hospital, and made by the said Robert and Agnes, 20<i>d.</i> and
it shall not be lawful for the said John, his heirs &amp;c. to
put in or out, any brother or sister during the lives of the
aforesaid Robert and Agnes.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He further informs us, that&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;in 17 Edward, IV. Edmund Bedingfeld, lord
of the manor of Hall Place, (in the hamlet of Seche Parva, in
South Lynn) and in a court held of the said manor, grants to

<p class="gutsumm"><i>Of the Red Mount</i>, <i>and our
Lady&rsquo;s Chapel there&mdash;also her Chapel by the Bridge
which still bears her name&mdash;St. Ann&rsquo;s Chapel</i>,
<i>with those of St. Catherine</i>, <i>St. Laurence</i>,
<i>&amp;c.</i></p>
<p>From the particular situation of the Red Mount, (on the
<i>out-side</i> of the town-walls, and within the wet foss which
flanked those walls,) there can be little doubt of its being once
a small fortress, or fortified and castellated place; so that it
might without much impropriety be denominated <i>a
castle</i>.&nbsp; What will further corroborate this opinion is a
fact noticed among our remarkable or memorable occurrences, that
in 1469 king Edward IV. came to Lynn with a great retinue, and
was lodged in this place; from which it may be very naturally
inferred and concluded, that it was then well fortified; for the
king in his then situation, (retreating before Warwick,) would
hardly have been lodged without the walls in an unfortified
place.&nbsp; From the same premises it may be likewise fairly
inferred, that it was also a <i>large</i> and <i>sumptuous</i>
structure&mdash;Edward&rsquo;s numerous retinue requiring it to
be of the former description, and his royal dignity of the
latter: had it been <i>small</i> it could not have accommodated
so large a company, and had it been <i>mean</i>, the <i>king</i>
would not have been lodged there&mdash;<a
name="citation554"></a><a href="#footnote554"
class="citation">[554]</a>&nbsp; But however strong, large, or
sumptuous the <a name="page555"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
555</span>edifice on the Red Mount then was, most of it has long
ago disappeared, and the little that now remains is chiefly the
chapel, which was once of considerable celebrity, but is now in a
dilapidated state.&nbsp; Of this curious piece of antiquity, one
of the most remarkable that Lynn can boast of, the following
description has lately appeared in a popular and respectable
work, which we have often before referred to&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;At the eastern extremity of the town is a
curious ancient building, called <span class="smcap">The
Lady&rsquo;s Chapel</span>, or <i>The Red Mount</i>.&nbsp; It has
been erroneously named a <i>castle</i>, but is evidently an
ecclesiastical structure. <a name="citation555a"></a><a
href="#footnote555a" class="citation">[555a]</a>&nbsp; It
consists of an octagonal wall of red brick and is constructed on
a very singular plan, of which, perhaps, not a similar example is
to be found in the kingdom.&nbsp; Within the exterior wall is a
handsome cruciform chapel, measuring from east to west seventeen
feet seven inches, by fourteen from north to south, and thirteen
in height.&nbsp; The roof is formed of stone, with numerous
groins, &amp;c. and exactly resembles the much admired ceiling of
King&rsquo;s College Chapel, Cambridge.&nbsp; This curious
building is in a dilapidated state, and it is much feared will
soon fall a victim to neglect and wantonness.&nbsp; Such a
singular edifice should be carefully preserved, and as the
expence to effect this would be trivial, it is hoped the
corporation, to whom it belongs, will not neglect it, and thereby
entail on themselves the perpetual reproaches of history, and the
lasting censures of antiquarian record.&rdquo; <a

</a></p>
<p><a name="page556"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 556</span>At
what time this notable fabrick was erected, does not appear; but
we may pretty safely conclude that it was at a period subsequent
to the conquest, and perhaps not before the 12th or 13th
century.&nbsp; It appears to have been dissolved, or laid by, at
the reformation, and it was defaced, as Parkin says, before the
3rd of Elizabeth.&nbsp; As there has been little or no attention
bestowed upon it ever since that time, it is no wonder that it
should be now in so ruinous a state.&nbsp; It has been often said
that this place was, in its day, the receptable of the pilgrims,
in their way to, and from Walsingham.&nbsp; If so, it amounts to
a pretty good proof, that it was very capacious, and well
endowed, or furnished with ample revenues; for the pilgrims to
Walsingham, like those to Loretto, swarmed on all the roads that
led thither; but on no road more, or perhaps so much as that
through Lynn, as all the devout people from the northern and
north western parts of the kingdom must have passed this way,
perhaps by hundreds at a time.&nbsp; That house must have been
both large and wealthy, that could lodge and entertain such hosts
of travellers.&mdash;Another reason for pilgrims frequenting our
chapel on the Mount might be, because there was there also an
image of the Virgin, which had attained to some celebrity; not
indeed like that at Walsingham, <a name="citation556"></a><a
href="#footnote556" class="citation">[556]</a> but evidently <a
name="page557"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 557</span>beyond any
thing of the kind at Lynn.&nbsp; We may therefore be very sure
that the holy travellers to Walsingham would pay a greater regard
to the chapel of our Lady on the Mount than to any other
religions place in this town.&nbsp; It has been observed before,
that the offerings to this image of the Virgin on the Mount
exceeded sometimes the offerings to all our other images and in
all our other religious houses here, numerous as they were.&nbsp;
In short, we may venture to affirm, that in former days no one
place in Lynn was of greater note or celebrity than the Red
Mount, and especially our Lady&rsquo;s Chapel and Image
there.</p>
<p>Of the <i>Chapel of our Lady on the Bridge</i>, we know much
less than of that on the Mount, though our knowledge of the
latter also is but very imperfect.&nbsp; When the former was
erected, whether before or after the other, or why there should
be two chapels in this town dedicated to the Virgin, are
questions which we are unable to resolve.&nbsp; They were both
probably more ancient than some of our other religious houses:
but they were dissolved, or laid by at the same time with most of
the rest.&nbsp; They were probably demolished not long after, and
this on the bridge much more entirely than the other.&nbsp; <a
name="page558"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 558</span>Parkin
says, that this chapel was defaced before the reign of Elizabeth,
as appears by an inquisition taken in her third year.&nbsp; Our
Lady&rsquo;s Gild in Lynn had seemingly some connection with this
chapel, as well as with that on the Mount; but we know too little
of the constitution and circumstances of that ancient fraternity
to pronounce any thing positively on this head. <a
name="citation558"></a><a href="#footnote558"
class="citation">[558]</a>&nbsp; Some small remains of this
chapel, converted into a little dwelling, stood, till very
lately, on the eastern side of the bridge; but when the said
bridge was widened, by order of the paving-act commissioners,
those remains were entirely removed, and there is no longer one
stone upon another of that consecrated and venerated fabrick, or
the least sign or indication, except in the name of the bridge,
that such an edifice ever stood there.&mdash;The modern
substitutes for this and the other ancient chapels, here
suppressed and demolished, are <i>four</i> very decent and
commodious dissenting meeting houses; one in New Conduit Street,
one in Clough Lane, and two in Broad Street; all, or most of
them, at present pretty well attended.&nbsp; Of each of which a
particular account shall be given in the course of this work.</p>
<p><a name="page559"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 559</span>Of
St. <i>Ann&rsquo;s Chapel</i> very little is at present
known.&nbsp; That it stood somewhere near St. <i>Ann&rsquo;s
Fort</i>, and that the latter took its name from it, can scarcely
be doubted.&nbsp; The stones that are still to be seen in some of
the adjacent walls did once, in all probability, belong to this
ancient consecrated structure. <a name="citation559"></a><a
href="#footnote559" class="citation">[559]</a>&nbsp; We have,
however, no reason to suppose that it was a very large edifice,
but rather one of our smaller size chapels, like that of <i>our
Lady on the Bridge</i>, and some others.&nbsp; It probably stood
contiguous to other houses, without any yard, or burying-ground
adjoining; which may be one, and, perhaps, the chief reason, why
its site has so entirely disappeared, so as to baffle, or render
fruitless every attempt to discover the exact spot on which it
stood.&nbsp; All that can now be fairly concluded is, that it
must have been somewhere near the Fort.</p>
<p>The site of <i>St. Catherine&rsquo;s Chapel</i> seems to be
involved in still greater uncertainty than even that of St. <a
name="page560"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 560</span>Ann.&nbsp;
By something that the present writer has somewhere met with, he
has been led to think, that this chapel stood without the East
Gates, and at no great distance; but as he cannot now recollect
upon what he founded that opinion, he will not take upon him here
to defend it, or assert that the chapel actually stood
there.&nbsp; Parkin owns that he did not know where it stood, but
says that it was defaced before the 3rd of Elizabeth, as appears
by an inquisition then taken.&nbsp; He also says that it is
&ldquo;mentioned in 1497, and the charity Gyld of the town of
Lenn,&rdquo; which, as he supposes, may allude to our houses of
lepers.&nbsp; But those houses were probably not under the
direction of any one of the gilds, but rather of a particular
religious order, called <i>the order of St. Lazarus of
Jerusalem</i>; of which, however, we know not enough to give here
a particular account of it.&nbsp; But as to the chapel in
question, Parkin further informs us that &ldquo;in 5 Richard II.
Henry le Despencer, bishop of Norwich, wrote a letter to Roger
Paxman, mayor, and to the burgesses of Lynn, wherein he desires
that they would, for the love they bore for the bishop, grant
part of the <i>house of St. Catherine</i> to one John Consolif,
late servant to his brother, the lord le Despencer, there to live
a solitary life, upon the alms of the good people; the other part
of the house belonging to the archdeacon of Norwich, being before
granted to the said John Consolyf.&rdquo; <a
name="citation560"></a><a href="#footnote560"
class="citation">[560]</a>&nbsp; This shews that there was here
formerly a House or Hospital, as well as a Chapel, dedicated to
St. Catherine; to which house or hospital, in all probability,
the said chapel belonged: but whether they pertained <a
name="page561"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 561</span>to our
Lazarettos, or were founded for some other purposes, it is very
difficult now to determine.&nbsp; Beside this chapel of St.
Catherine, there was here another chapel dedicated to her, in the
church of the friars preachers, or Dominicans: <a
name="citation561a"></a><a href="#footnote561a"
class="citation">[561a]</a> but this was nothing very remarkable,
as we had here also more than one chapel dedicated to the
Trinity, as well as to the blessed virgin, if not likewise to
some others.</p>
<p>The <i>Chapel of St. Lawrence</i>, (like those of St.
Catherine and St. John) appears to have belonged to the
<i>Hospital</i> of the same name, and therefore must have stood
at Hardwick, contiguous, probably, or very near to the said
hospital.&nbsp; That house being one of our Lazarettos, its use,
or designation is sufficiently obvious.&nbsp; We learn from
Parkin,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;that John Duraunt Esq. in the 27 Henry VI.
granted to Robert Synkclere and Agnes his wife the hospital, or
house of lepars, with the <i>chapel of St. Lawrence</i> situate
on the cawsey of Hardwyke, by Lynn&mdash;Also that William
Walton, Esq. and Catherine, his wife, daughter and heiress of the
said John Duraunt Esq. conveyed by fine, in Hillary term, 36th
year of the same reign, to Sir Thomas Tudenham, knight, the
<i>advouson of the chapel of St. Lawrence</i>, with the manor of
Hall Place, and divers other possessions. <a
name="citation561b"></a><a href="#footnote561b"
class="citation">[561b]</a>&nbsp; This chapel seems therefore to
have been an endowed place, whose advouson was deemed an object
of no trivial consideration.&nbsp; The hospital to which it
belonged, as well as the rest of our Lazar houses, may <a
name="page562"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 562</span>be supposed
to have been in some sort of subjection to the master of the
order of St. Lazarus, whose chief residence, or station, appears
to have been at Burton Lazars, in Leicestershire.&nbsp; Parkin
mentions a remarkable deed which he had seen, whereby brother
Richard de Sulegrave, knight, master of the whole order of St.
Lazarus of Jerusalem, and all the brethren of the said order,
dwelling at Burton, by common assent and council of the whole
chapter, grant to Alan de Kele, burgess of Lenn, his heirs and
assigns, a certain piece of land, called Lazar Hill, lying by the
common wall of the said village, containing 7 perches and 7 feet
in breadth, on the north side; and 10 perches and 14 feet, on the
south side; 5 perches and half broad, on the east side; 6 perches
broad in the middle, and 7 on the west side, &amp;c. <a
name="citation562"></a><a href="#footnote562"
class="citation">[562]</a>&nbsp; This seems, by the names of the
witnesses, to have been as early as the reign of king John.&nbsp;
&ldquo;This piece of land,&rdquo; (our author adds) &ldquo;I find
afterwards in the hands of Rd. Spany and John de Teryngton, in
the reign of Richard II.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But the present writer is not able to point out this
remarkable spot, or yet to describe the nature and extent of that
jurisdiction which the master and chapter of the order of St.
Lazarus had over the Lynn Lazarettos.</p>
<p>Most if not all the rest of the smaller chapels were attached
to, or connected with our different churches and convents, of
which several belonged to St. Margaret&rsquo;s church: we will
therefore give here no separate account of them.&nbsp; Such
little chapels and chauntries were pretty <a
name="page563"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 563</span>numerous
here, and mark the character of the inhabitants, and particularly
the most devout part of them, in those times.&nbsp; There was
here also in former ages, at least one <a
name="citation563a"></a><a href="#footnote563a"
class="citation">[563a]</a> <i>hermitage</i>, or retreat of an
anchoret, and that was at the Crouch, or <i>Crutch</i>, as it is
now commonly called.&nbsp; Of this remarkable place, and its
adjacent cross, Parkin gives the following account&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The mayor and commonalty petition William
(Bateman) bishop of Norwich, begging his favour towards John
Puttock, to admit him as a hermit, who had, in the bishop&rsquo;s
marsh by Lenn, on the sea shore, in a certain place, called Lenn
Crouch, made a cave there, till he could build himself a proper
mansion; purposing, as he declares, to spend all his time, by
your permission and license, in the service of God there: and the
said John Puttock has there erected a certain remarkable cross,
of great service for all shipping coming that way, of the height
of 110 feet, at his own great cost and charge.&rdquo; <a
name="citation563b"></a><a href="#footnote563b"
class="citation">[563b]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This occurred as long ago as 1349.&nbsp; To our thinking the
Crutch must be a most improper and strange place for a hermitage,
where people are continually passing and repassing, and those, at
least many of them, some of the rudest and most lawless of the
whole population.&nbsp; How the hermits did there in popish times
we know not, but we are apt to think that they would not fare
very comfortably there in this protestant age.</p>

<p>The founder of this chapel, as well as that of St. Nicholas,
according to our best accounts, was <span class="smcap">William
Turb</span>, or <i>Turbus</i>, alias <i>De Turba Villa</i>, or
<i>Turbeville</i>, the third bishop of Norwich, who was promoted
to that see in 1146, <a name="citation564a"></a><a

reign, as Parkin refers to a certain charter of that bishop,
which proves that it was in being at the commencement of the next
reign. <a name="citation564b"></a><a href="#footnote564b"
class="citation">[564b]</a>&nbsp; Both this of St. James and that
of St. Nicholas were chapels of ease to the church of St.
Margaret.&nbsp; These three churches had in those times abundance
of officiating priests, or chaplains.&nbsp; The great fraternity,
called <i>Trinity Gild</i>, alone, maintained no less than
<i>thirteen</i>; six for St. Margaret&rsquo;s, <i>four</i> for
St. Nicholas&rsquo;s, and <i>three</i> for St. James&rsquo;s. <a

not appear; but they had, no doubt, several more.&nbsp; This
chapel is said to contain in length five score feet, and in
breadth 24 feet; exclusive of the cross aisle, and a chapel
attached to it, dedicated to the Trinity.&nbsp; The altar of St.
Lawrence stood somewhere in this chapel, and, at the east end of
it, an image of our Saviour, to which devout folks were wont to
bring their offerings.&nbsp; A particular division of the town
appears to have been at one time consigned or appropriated to the
officiating services of the chaplains or clergy of this chapel,
comprehending, probably, all on the sides next to it of Damgate,
Broadstreet, Blackboystreet and <a name="page565"></a><span

<p>At the general dissolution this chapel was, it seems, laid by,
and shut up, which appears an odd and unaccountable circumstance,
as it had not any connection with the convents, being merely a
parochial place of worship.&nbsp; We are told that it was pulled
down, all but the cross aisle, in 1549, (by order of the mayor
and corporation, it is supposed,) when it had four bells, which
were worth, with the bell of the charnel-house, CC<i>l.</i>&nbsp;
We are further told, &ldquo;that there did also, in the mean
time, belong to the said chapel and charnel-house, stone, iron,
and glass, to the value of one hundred marks: also timber and
lead to the value of 300<i>l.</i> also plate, jewels, and stock,
to the value of 200<i>l.</i> also certain lands and tenements in
Lynn, to the yearly value of 5<i>l.</i>&rdquo; <a
name="citation565b"></a><a href="#footnote565b"
class="citation">[565b]</a>&nbsp; All this property appears to
have come into the hands of the mayor and corporation; not very
fairly and honourably, it seems; for we find that it rather
belonged <a name="page566"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
566</span>to the Dean and Chapter of Norwich, who, about
seventeen years after, on what occasion does not appear,
relinquished their right and claim to it, by a formal deed to
that purpose, a copy of which is given below. <a
name="citation566a"></a><a href="#footnote566a"
class="citation">[566a]</a>&nbsp; This was about the year 1566.
<a name="citation566b"></a><a href="#footnote566b"
class="citation">[566b]</a>&nbsp; From that period it lay,
probably, in ruins till 1581, when it was, at the expense of the
corporation, prepared and made a <a name="page567"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 567</span>place for the manufacture of bays,
&amp;c.&mdash;How long it was occupied for that purpose is not
said; but we learn that the undertaking did not
succeed.&mdash;About a century after, in the year 1682, it was
repaired and fitted up, by the liberal benefactions of the
corporation and principal inhabitants, and converted into a
hospital, or workhouse for fitly decayed old men, women, and poor
children; a good endowment and provision being made for their
work, instructions, and maintenance, and for putting the children
out to trades.&mdash;On that occasion were made and adopted the
following</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>Rules</i>, <i>Ordinances</i> and
<i>Statutes</i> made and established by the mayor and burgesses
of the burgh of King&rsquo;s Lynn in the county of Norfolk, for
the good government of the Hospital or Workhouse of St. James,
there erected and founded, and of the children&rsquo;s being, and
to be placed therein.&mdash;<i>Imprimis</i>, That the children be
instructed in their duty towards God, and in good
manners.&mdash;That the master for the time being shall cause the
children every Lord&rsquo;s day, both in the forenoon and
afternoon, constantly to repair to the parish church of St.
Margaret, diligently to attend divine service and sermons
there.&mdash;That some fit person, to be elected by the mayor and
burgesses, shall daily read the prayers and collects appointed
for that purpose in the chapel of the said house, every morning
by eight of the clock, and every evening by four of the clock
precisely, all the children there attending with becoming
reverence.&mdash;That such person, after prayers so read at the
<a name="page568"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 568</span>times
aforesaid, shall teach the children to read for the space of one
hour and an half, twice in the day, by calling together four at a
time, and no more, whilst the rest are at work.&mdash;That such
person every Sunday, after divine service in the afternoon,
calling all the said children into the chapel, shall instruct
them in the church Catechism appointed for children, for the
space of one hour, concluding with the prayers and collects.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Item</span>, <i>For their
Recreation and Correction</i>.&nbsp; That the children be kept at
work between our <i>Lady</i> and <i>Michaelmas</i> from Six of
the clock in the morning till Twelve at noon; and between
<i>Michaelmas</i> and <i>our Lady</i> from Eight till twelve, and
in all afternoons from One to Seven: the time for prayers,
reading, and refreshment, excepted.&nbsp; That on festivals and
holy-days observed by the church, and every Thursday after three
in the afternoon, they be allowed reasonable recreation.&nbsp;
That for offences committed, gentle and moderate chastisement be
given; and such as will not thereby be reformed, be sent to the
house of correction, to be there punished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Item</span>, <i>For their Diet</i>,
<i>Cloaths</i>, <i>Firing</i>, and <i>necessary
Provisions</i>.&nbsp; That three days in the week they have once
in the day competent allowance of flesh meat hot, and three other
days like allowance of other hot provision, to be ready at twelve
at noon; and on the other day fit provision; as also a reasonable
breakfast and supper every day of the week.&nbsp; That all sorts
of provision, bread, beer, and meat, and all other victuals, <a
name="page569"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 569</span>be good,
fresh, and wholesome.&nbsp; That once every year, a month before
Christmas, they be allowed new suits of cloaths of the usual
colours, and new shifting, shoes, and stockings, so often as it
shall be necessary and convenient, and washing allowed
them.&nbsp; That out of six chaldron of coals to be allowed to
the master, a convenient fire be kept in the working-room all the
cold season of the year.&nbsp; That such children as shall appear
to be sick, be removed into a room for that purpose; and if any
be infirm, or taken with contagious distempers (such as are
catching) that special care be taken to lodge them apart from the
others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Item</span>, <i>For the
Visitation</i>, <i>Overseeing</i>, <i>Defraying necessary
charges</i>, and <i>Regulation of Abuses</i>.&nbsp; That on the
usual day of electing the corporation officers in every year, the
mayor, aldermen, and common-council, or the major part of them,
shall elect and choose <i>three</i> discreet and fitting persons
to be <i>governors</i> of the same Hospital, or Workhouse, for
the year from <i>Michaelmas</i> thence next ensuing, whose care
shall be to inspect and oversee the same, and the children
therein, from time to time; and to order and direct all expences,
charges, payments, and disbursements concerning the same; and to
see and cause all the rules, ordinances, and statutes thereof to
be put in due execution.&mdash;That all gifts, benevolences,
contributions, payments, and sums of money whatsoever, now or
hereafter to be made and given to the same Hospital or Workhouse,
or the poor children therein, shall from time to time be paid
into the <a name="page570"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
570</span>hands of such governors; and a true account thereof,
and of all expences, charges, payments and disbursements
concerning the same, shall yearly be made and audited on the
usual day appointed for auditing the accompts of the mayor and
burgesses.&mdash;That a book be kept, wherein all gifts and
benevolences, that have been or shall hereafter be given to, or
bestowed on the said Hospital or Workhouse, or the poor children
therein, shall be fairly registered, to be kept in the said
chapel.&mdash;That one other book be kept, wherein the names or
times of placing or removing of all masters and poor children of
the same Hospital or Workhouse shall be entered and
recorded.&mdash;That a sufficient chest or box be provided, with
two locks, for the reposing and safe keeping therein the <i>Deeds
of Foundation</i>, <i>Endowment</i>, and other writings, that do
or shall belong thereunto, as also the <i>common seal</i> of the
said Hospital, or Workhouse; one key whereof to remain with the
mayor of this burgh for the time being, the other with the senior
governor thereof.&mdash;That the mayor, aldermen, and
common-councilmen, or so many as shall think fit, by appointment
of the mayor for the time being, shall four times in every year,
or oftener if need require, visit the said hospital or workhouse,
for the better encouragement thereof, and discovering abuses that
may be committed contrary to these rules and ordinances.&rdquo;
<a name="citation570"></a><a href="#footnote570"
class="citation">[570]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;The first Collection among the inhabitants towards this
charitable design, and preparing this chapel, amounted to the sum
of 406<i>l.</i> 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>&mdash;The Corporation also
<a name="page571"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 571</span>made an
order among themselves, That every Alderman new elected should
pay at his admittance 10<i>l.</i> and every common-council-man 20
nobles, which, to the year ending at Lady day 1724, amounted to
726<i>l.</i> 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>&nbsp; The legacies of persons
deceased (besides other benefactions) given to the same&rdquo;
[up to the above specified time] &ldquo;amounted to 90<i>l.</i>
0<i>s.</i> 0<i>d.</i>&mdash;In all 1222<i>l.</i> 14<i>s.</i>
10<i>d.</i>&mdash;They also endowed it with 20<i>l.</i> <i>per
annum</i>.&rdquo; <a name="citation571a"></a><a
href="#footnote571a" class="citation">[571a]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For some reason, to us unknown, the above order of things did
not long continue.&nbsp; In the course of a few years another
revolution took place: most, if not all the above regulations
were repealed, or laid aside, and the house, by an act of
parliament, was consigned to the superintendence and management
of the <i>Guardians of the Poor</i>. <a
name="citation571b"></a><a href="#footnote571b"
class="citation">[571b]</a>&nbsp; That act passed in 1701, the
12th of William III. <i>For erecting Hospitals and Workhouses in
King&rsquo;s Lynn</i>.&nbsp; It contains, as Mackerell observes,
the following clause&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>The Workhouse</i>, <i>founded by the
mayor and burgesses</i>, <i>called</i> St. James&rsquo;s
Workhouse, <i>and all lands</i>, <i>tenements</i>, <i>rents</i>,
<i>revenues</i>, <i>goods</i>, <i>and chattels</i>, <i>belonging
to the same</i>, <i>are by this act vested and settled in the</i>
guardians of the poor, and their successors.&rdquo; <a
name="citation571c"></a><a href="#footnote571c"
class="citation">[571c]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We are further told, that by another clause in this act, it
was to continue in force <i>only so long as the rates did not
exceed what had been paid towards the </i><a
name="page572"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
572</span><i>maintenance of the poor</i>, <i>for any one of the
then three last years</i>. <a name="citation572"></a><a
href="#footnote572" class="citation">[572]</a>&nbsp; That excess,
no doubt, took place pretty soon, though we have not learnt the
exact year when it so happened: and yet the guardians, it seems,
long after, and even till very lately, acted under that same
obsolete law; a conduct which may be thought not altogether
justifiable or defensible.&nbsp; But as the proverb says, that
&ldquo;half a loaf is better than no bread,&rdquo; so they might
judge that an obsolete law was better than no law.&nbsp; However
that was, one would think that they must cease to be guardians,
when the law that constituted them such lost its authority, or
ceased to be in force.</p>
<p>From the period when the superintendence and management of St.
James&rsquo;s Hospital were committed to the guardians, it
appears to have become the proper poor house of St.
Margaret&rsquo;s parish, and general workhouse of the
town.&mdash;Of the exact state and regular variations of the poor
rates in Lynn during the first sixty years, and more, after the
above act had passed, we have but little knowledge; but <i>for
the last forty years</i> our information is much more extensive
and authentic.&nbsp; During this period our poor-rates, or what
we have raised for the support of the poor, have increased
<i>tenfold</i>, and the number of paupers <i>four</i> or <i>five
fold</i>.&mdash;In 1770 these rates amounted to only
976<i>l.</i>&mdash;In 1796 they amounted to
7713<i>l.</i>&mdash;and in 1809 to about, or near 9000<i>l.</i>
and the whole expenditure, up to the end of January in the
present year, (1810) to the enormous sum of 10,243<i>l.</i>
10<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i>&mdash;for, after the manner of our
superiors, who sit above <a name="page573"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 573</span>at the helm, we manage and contrive
that our outgoings should exceed our income.&mdash;The following
statements of our out-door expenditure in two different years,
(the first and the last of the above period,) extracted from Mr.
Grisenthwaite&rsquo;s Remarks, p. 19 and 20, may throw some
further light upon this subject.</p>

<p>The difference between the latter and the former of the above
Statements, in so short a period, comprehending only a part of
the present prosperous reign, and what some seem to deem the most
blessed and glorious part of if, must be exceedingly remarkable
and wonderful.&nbsp; <a name="page575"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 575</span>In 1770 the rates of the town were
only 4<i>s.</i> in the pound on the rent, raising an annual
revenue of 976<i>l</i>; of which 579<i>l.</i> were appropriated
for the use of the out door poor, leaving only 397<i>l.</i> for
the maintenance of the Workhouse and all other contingent
expences.&nbsp; Thus the total expenditure of the House was then
only 397<i>l</i>; now it is 3496<i>l.</i> 3<i>s.</i>
5<i>d.</i>&mdash;Then the total annual expenditure for both the
in-door and out-door poor was only 976<i>l</i>; now it is above
10,000<i>l.</i> <a name="citation575a"></a><a
href="#footnote575a" class="citation">[575a]</a>&nbsp; Of course,
the charge for the maintenance of the poor is now become a very
serious matter, and even a heavy and grievous burden to many of
the inhabitants.</p>
<p>Our poor rates have arrived at their present unexampled height
under the <i>new</i> heaven-born <i>poor-law</i>, which was to be
the prolific parent of so many inestimable blessings to the town;
not one of which, alas! has yet been, or is ever likely to be
realized.&nbsp; This memorable law, and its worthy twin-sister,
the <i>paving law</i>, have been already productive of
incalculable mischief.&nbsp; The vast additional burden which
they have brought upon the inhabitants has lessened the value of
houses 15 or 20 per cent, and multiplied the number of untenanted
dwellings to five or six score, at least. <a
name="citation575b"></a><a href="#footnote575b"

name="page576"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 576</span>For such a

<p>When it was made to appear that the poor rates of Lynn
amounted to nearly, if not quite, as much as those of <i>Hull</i>
and <i>Exeter</i>, places three times its population, it was
impossible to avoid suspecting the existence of some sad
mismanagement, if not also of most foul and criminal
misdoings.&nbsp; The same suspicion was not likely to be
lessened, but rather to issue in full conviction, when it was
discovered, that the maintenance of each pauper in this
workhouse, or hospital, costs even more than that of each
pensioner in <i>Greenwich Hospital</i>, <a
name="citation576b"></a><a href="#footnote576b"
class="citation">[576b]</a> <a name="page577"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 577</span>and twice or thrice as much as that
of each pauper in some, if not all, of the most noted and
respectable workhouses, or poorhouses in the kingdom.&nbsp; That
the report of these circumstances, with the increasing pressure
of the rates, should excite a spirit of mistrust, inquiry, and
investigation in the town, was no more than what might naturally
be expected.&nbsp; It accordingly did so happen: and the result
proved that the previous suspicious were not groundless.</p>
<p>In the course of the investigation, <i>Butcher&rsquo;s
Meat</i> appeared to be here consumed in such unusual quantities
<a name="citation577a"></a><a href="#footnote577a"
class="citation">[577a]</a> as are utterly irreconcilable with
any and every idea of economy and good management: and in the
article of <i>Cheese</i> the consumption appeared to be still
more palpably disproportionate, unexampled, and excessive; so as
to set the wisdom and competency of our managers in a very
unfavourable and unseemly point of view.&mdash;This the reader
will easily perceive, when he is told, that it costs in this
house, for cheese alone, between 4 and 5<i>l.</i> a week, or that
there is consumed here weekly no less than 1 Cwt. of that
article.&nbsp; That this is out of all proportion to what is
usual in other Poor-houses, will appear from the following
statement, extracted from Mr. Grisenthwaite late publication. <a
name="citation577b"></a><a href="#footnote577b"
class="citation">[577b]</a></p>
<p>At the <i>Norwich</i> Poor-houses, among 1343 persons, during
one of the late years of scarcity, the annual expence for
<i>cheese</i> was 135<i>l.</i> 2<i>s.</i> 5<i>d.</i>&mdash;At
<i>Shrewsbury</i>, <a name="page578"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
578</span>among 274 persons, (in 1801, if we are not mistaken,)
the annual expence for the same article was 56<i>l.</i>
2<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>&mdash;At <i>Hull</i>, in 1808, (number of
persons not mentioned, but doubtless, not fewer than those in our
Poor-house,) the annual expence for the said article was
29<i>l.</i> 16<i>s.</i>&mdash;At <i>Lynn</i>, the same year,
among 200 persons, for that article, 226<i>l.</i>
8<i>s.</i>&mdash;At the same town, among about the same number of
persons, for the last year, (1809,) the annual expence for that
very article amounted to the still more enormous sum of
259<i>l.</i> 15<i>s.</i> 11<i>d.</i> <a
name="citation578a"></a><a href="#footnote578a"
class="citation">[578a]</a>&mdash;If we go on at this rate, we
shall soon have 3 or 400<i>l.</i> a year to pay <i>for cheese
only</i>, for the use of our Workhouse; a sum equal to what the
whole of that establishment cost <i>forty years ago</i>. <a
name="citation578b"></a><a href="#footnote578b"
class="citation">[578b]</a></p>
<p>The statement here following will shew the respective and
total amount of the expence of the other articles consumed in
this house within the last year, with the proportion they bore to
the single article above specified.&mdash;The <i>Butter</i> used
in this house for the whole year cost 30<i>l.</i> 11<i>s.</i>
l<i>d.</i>&mdash;The <i>Milk</i> 33<i>l.</i> 14<i>s.</i>
2<i>d.</i>&mdash;<i>Potatoes</i> 37<i>l.</i>
2<i>s.</i>&mdash;<i>Oatmeal</i> and <i>Peas</i> 56<i>l.</i>
6<i>s.</i>&nbsp; [Total 157<i>l.</i> 13<i>s.</i>
3<i>d.</i>]&nbsp; That the sum total of the expence for the above
four, or rather <i>five</i> articles, should fall short above
100<i>l.</i> of what it cost for cheese only, must surely be very
strange: and yet it appears not to be more strange than
true.&nbsp; The whole year&rsquo;s expence for <i>Grocery</i> was
158<i>l.</i> 1<i>s.</i> 7<i>d.</i>&mdash;And for <i>Beer</i>,
157<i>l.</i> 7<i>s.</i>&mdash;Here also it may be thought not a
little remarkable, that the <i>Grocery</i> and even the <a
name="page579"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
579</span><i>Beverage</i> used here should so much fall short of
the <i>Cheese</i> as each of them not to amount to very much
above half the expence of that article.&nbsp; Of the two most
important articles, <i>Flour</i> and <i>Meat</i>, (the only two
which exceeded the expence of <i>cheese</i>!) the former,
including <i>Bread</i>, cost 1001<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i> 9<i>d.</i>
<a name="citation579a"></a><a href="#footnote579a"
class="citation">[579a]</a>&mdash;and the latter, (<i>Meat</i>,)
cost 1110<i>l.</i>&mdash;<i>Coals</i> cost 134<i>l.</i>
5<i>s.</i> 10<i>d.</i>&mdash;<i>Turf</i> 9<i>l.</i>
3<i>s.</i>&mdash;<i>Oil</i> 8<i>l.</i> 4<i>s.</i>&mdash;The total
expenditure of the house for the whole year, including sundry
other articles, with repairs, &amp;c. 3496<i>l.</i> 3<i>s.</i>
5<i>d.</i> <a name="citation579b"></a><a href="#footnote579b"
class="citation">[579b]</a>&mdash;and with the disbursements to
the out-door pensioners, the entire expenditure, up to the end of
last January, as was before observed, appeared to amount to
10,243<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i> 3<i>d.</i>: <a
name="citation579c"></a><a href="#footnote579c"
class="citation">[579c]</a> an enormous sum, surely, for a town
that does not contain 11,000 inhabitants, or any manufacture, or
even any trade <i>now</i>, of much consequence, except the
<i>coal trade</i>.&nbsp; Under these circumstances, such a rapid
and vast increase of poor, and of the poor rates, must amount to
an irrefragable proof, that we are now in a state of actual and
fast declension, whatever some people may insinuate, or pretend
to the contrary.&nbsp; But the more evident this declension is,
the more incumbent it must be on those who have the management of
our affairs to observe the utmost economy, and spare as much as
possible the industrious and lower orders of the community, who
can <a name="page580"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 580</span>so
ill bear the burden of additional charges.&nbsp; Whether they
have hitherto ever thought of this, or not, it seems to be now
high time that it should occupy its full share of their
attention. <a name="citation580a"></a><a href="#footnote580a"
class="citation">[580a]</a></p>
<p>It has also been thought, or rather suspected, that our
distributers of parochial relief do not always distribute or
administer that relief with judgment and discrimination, or even
with a scrupulous or due regard to justice and impartiality: and
such statements as the following might be supposed to afford some
colour or countenance to such suspicions&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>Weekly allowances</i>&mdash;To a man and
wife and 5 children, 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>&nbsp; To a young
woman, aged 24, and one child 2<i>s.</i>&mdash;To a man and wife
near 70 years of age, 1<i>s.</i>&nbsp; To a single woman, aged
19, 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>&mdash;To a widow, aged 76,
2<i>s.</i>&nbsp; To a single woman, aged 31, 2<i>s.</i>
6<i>d.</i>&mdash;To a widow, aged 78, 2<i>s.</i>&nbsp; To a
single woman, aged 22, 1<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>&mdash;To an aged
woman, 102 years old, 2<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>&nbsp; To a widow,
aged 48, 3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>&mdash;To a widow, aged 38, with 3
children, 3<i>s.</i>&nbsp; To a single woman, aged 36, 2<i>s.</i>
6<i>d.</i>&rdquo; <a name="citation580b"></a><a
href="#footnote580b" class="citation">[580b]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such a Statement, which may be taken as a sample, or specimen
of our out-door distributions, <a name="page581"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 581</span>has something like partiality, or
inconsiderateness, marked on its very
forehead.&mdash;&ldquo;Kisses,&rdquo; according to the old adage,
&ldquo;go by favour;&rdquo; and so, it is to be feared, do our
out-door parochial allowances, in too many instances.&nbsp; But
upon this topic we will not now enlarge, as we may have occasion
hereafter to resume the subject, in the latter part of the work.
<a name="citation581a"></a><a href="#footnote581a"
class="citation">[581a]</a></p>
<p>At this time (July 1810) a revolution, or new arrangement is
said to be actually taking place among our indoor-pensioners, or
in the management of St. James&rsquo;s Hospital, from which very
important benefits are expected soon to result: and it is much to
be wished that the event may correspond with the present
expectations.&nbsp; The household expences have been already, it
seems much reduced, <a name="citation581b"></a><a
href="#footnote581b" class="citation">[581b]</a> without the
least detriment to the poor inmates; and we hear, that the plan
is to be followed up with the strictest attention to sound and
rigid economy.&nbsp; The present state of the town certainly
requires it, and those who have come forward on this occasion
seem to be very much in earnest; but it remains to be seen how
far our present hopes and expectations will be realized, or
whether, after all, we are not destined to be, in this case, as
we have been in many others, the miserable victims of delusion
and disappointment. <a name="citation581c"></a><a
href="#footnote581c" class="citation">[581c]</a></p>
<p><a name="page582"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 582</span>With
very little propriety, especially of late years, has our St.
James&rsquo;s Hospital been called a <i>Work</i>-house: it might
full as well, and even better, have been called a
<i>play</i>-house; for it is certain that there is more
<i>play</i> than <i>work</i> going on there.&nbsp; Among its 200
pensioners, <a name="page583"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
583</span>one half, at least, may be supposed capable of doing
some, and even a great deal of work: and yet all their earnings
during all the last year amounted to no more than 170<i>l.</i>
1<i>s.</i> 5<i>d.</i> which was at the rate of <i>little more
than a penny a day</i>.&nbsp; The work, therefore, done by the
numerous residents in this house is scarcely worth mentioning,
except for the purpose of exhibiting the palpable neglect and
mismanagement of the conductors, and their utter incompetency for
the charge which they have undertaken.&nbsp; As things have stood
hitherto, this house has been little better than a nest of sloth,
or an asylum for idleness; where young and strong paupers are so
treated as if it were actually wished and intended to unfit them,
as much as possible, for any future use or employment in society,
or as if their admission here had been meant for their ruin, and
not for their relief and benefit&mdash;Care, certainly, ought to
be taken, that the children, and youth, and hale people, in our
poor-houses, be inured to habits of industry, as well as provided
with food and raiment; otherwise, the succour afforded will be
most materially defective.</p>
<p>The foregoing narration, it is presumed, will enable the
reader to form a pretty accurate and adequate idea, of the
history of this notable house, from its first erection, or
foundation, in the reign of king Stephen, or that of his
successor, to the present time.&nbsp; At first, as has been
shewn, it was a chapel, or place of worship, of no small
consideration in the town, being little inferior to St.
Nicholas&rsquo; chapel, or even St. Margaret&rsquo;s <a
name="page584"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 584</span>church, and
continued to be so till the reformation, when it was
unaccountably desecrated, and most of it pulled down.&nbsp; After
which, it was appropriated successively to different uses, till
it became the poor-house of St. Margaret&rsquo;s parish, and the
general work-house of the town, with the annexation, of late
years, of extensive new buildings.&nbsp; This is its state at
present: but how long it may so continue, it is impossible to
say, as we can see but little into futurity.&nbsp; How far the
recent change and expected reform will realize or disappoint our
hopes, must be left at present among the mysteries.&nbsp; Time is
the only revealer of such secrets.&nbsp; We will now take our
leave of St. James&rsquo;s Chapel and Hospital, and proceed to
other matters, somewhat less connected with the affairs of the
present generation.</p>
<h3><a name="page585"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
585</span>CHAP. VII.</h3>
<p class="gutsumm">Brief biographical notices of the most
remarkable or distinguished personages that appeared among the
inhabitants of Lynn, in the intervening period between the
Conquest and the Reformation.</p>
<p>During the period now under consideration, it is not known
that many eminently distinguished, or very memorable characters
appeared among the inhabitants of this town, full as it was, in
the mean time, of ecclesiastics or priests, and monks or friars
of different orders, among whom was usually confined all the
little knowledge and learning that did then exist in the
nation.&nbsp; But though the population of Lynn, during the said
period, did not abound in characters of the above description,
yet it does not appear to have been altogether destitute of
them.&nbsp; The names of several have been preserved, who seem to
have made in their day no mean figure among their most
enlightened contemporaries; of whom the following were, perhaps,
the most estimable and worthy of remembrance.</p>
<p><a name="page586"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
586</span>1.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Nicholas de Lenna</span>,
or <i>Nicholas of Lynn</i>.&nbsp; He was a native of this town,
and flourished in the reign of Edward III.&nbsp; He was educated
at Oxford, where his literary proficiency may be supposed to have
been very considerable, as he afterwards appeared to exceed most
of his fellows, especially in some rare studies and
distinguishing departments.&nbsp; To him is supposed chiefly to
apply that observation of <i>Voltaire</i>, in his Essay on
Universal History, (vol. 3. pp. 182, 183.)&nbsp; &ldquo;That the
first [in Europe] who certainly made use of the <i>compass</i>
were the English, in the reign of Edward III.&rdquo; <a
name="citation586a"></a><a href="#footnote586a"
class="citation">[586a]</a>&nbsp; <i>Hackluyt</i>, in his
Voyages, makes particular and honourable mention of him,
observing, that Nicholas de Lenna, an excellent musician,
mathematician, and astrologer, bred at Oxford, after having
applied his studies chiefly to astronomy, by the help of his
Astrolabe, <a name="citation586b"></a><a href="#footnote586b"
class="citation">[586b]</a> made six voyages to the North seas,
of which he published an account, in a book entitled
&ldquo;<i>Inventio Fortunata</i> <a name="page587"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 587</span>(<i>aliter Fortun&aelig;</i>,)
<i>qui liber incipit a gradu</i> 54 <i>usq</i>; <i>ad
polum</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the first (which seems to have taken
place as early as 1330) he sailed from Lynn to Iceland, with
Company, whom he left on the sea-coast, while he himself
travelled up into the island in search of discoveries.&nbsp; He
presented his charts of the northern seas, at his return, (from
his last voyage, we may suppose) to Edward III, in 1360; and they
were afterwards made use of in the reign of Henry VI, and
probably much later.&nbsp; He died in 1369, and was buried at
Lynn.&nbsp; We are told that he was much esteemed by his
celebrated contemporary <i>Chaucer</i>, who styled him
&lsquo;Frere Nicholas Linn, a reverend clerke.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Like the great <i>Roger Bacon</i>, who lived about half a
century before him, Nicholas belonged to the religious order of
<i>Grey Friars</i>, or Franciscans, otherwise called Cordeliers,
and minor brethren. <a name="citation587"></a><a
href="#footnote587" class="citation">[587]</a>&nbsp; One is apt
to forget or overlook, in some measure, the extravagances of the
order, in the contemplation of its being capable of producing,
and that it actually did produce such men as these.&nbsp; As
Nicholas is supposed to have spent the most part of his time at
Lynn, among the brethren of his order, it may very naturally and
reasonably be concluded, or supposed, that the <i>Grey
Friars&rsquo; tower</i>, which is still standing, was often used
by him, as an <i>observatory</i>, in the course of his
astronomical <a name="page588"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
588</span>studies here; which may suggest no despicable reason
for preserving that ancient ruin from the ravages of time, and
keeping it up as long as possible.&nbsp; The repair which it
lately underwent must be creditable to the feelings of those by
whom it was promoted.&nbsp; It may seem somewhat odd and
remarkable that it has stood so long, and still exists, the last
and only remain of our numerous monasteries and conventual
towers; (though, perhaps, from the slightness of its structure,
the most unlikely of any of them to survive;) as if time, or
providence had favoured its preservation, by way of approval of
the useful purposes to which it had been once appropriated, or in
honour of the memory of him who so laudably occupied it, and was
so eminent a benefactor to his country.&nbsp; Much stress,
however, is not meant to be laid on these ideas: yet we cannot
help thinking that this supposed, or presumed and probable
observatory of our ancient astronomer and navigator is entitled
to some real and lasting respect from the enlightened part of our
population.</p>
<p>It has been already observed that our worthy and respectable
townsman, the subject of this brief memoir, died in 1369, and was
buried here, [in the church, or dormitory of the Grey Friars, in
all probability;] but at what age, does not appear: yet if his
first voyage took place in 1330, as it is said, he must have
lived to be pretty far advanced in years; it being not probable
that he was less than thirty when he set out on that
voyage.&nbsp; Between the first and sixth, or last of his voyages
there seem to have been nearly if not <a name="page589"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 589</span>quite thirty years.&nbsp; They were
all apparently voyages of discovery and experiment, and for
improvement in the art and knowledge of navigation, and proved,
no doubt, of no small advantage and benefit to his
countrymen.&nbsp; It is much to be wished that a particular
account of them had been preserved, which could not fail of being
very interesting; but as such an account is not known to exist,
our wishing for it must be all vain and useless.&nbsp; Any
records which our worthy voyager might leave behind him have
probably perished long ago; but we have from other sources
sufficient proofs that he must have been in his day an
extraordinary man, greatly distinguished as a mathematician and
astronomer, and especially as a navigator.&nbsp; He and the
person whose name next follows may pretty safely be deemed the
two most eminent characters that appeared among our townsmen,
during the long period of which we are now treating, or, perhaps,
during any other period.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">William Sawtre</span>, or
<i>Salter</i>, otherwise <i>Sawtry</i>, <i>Chawtrey</i> and
<i>Chatris</i>, and commonly called <i>Sir</i> William Sawtre,
&amp;c. it being usual in those days, and long after, to prefix
that title to the names of a certain description of
ecclesiastics.&nbsp; He is rendered peculiarly memorable as the
English <i>proto-martyr</i>; it being generally agreed that he
was the first Englishman that was burnt for his religion.&nbsp;
We have no authority to say of Sautre, as we did of Nicholas,
that he was born here.&nbsp; The place of his birth, as far as we
know, has been no where mentioned.&nbsp; It appears that he took
up his residence and settled here, as parish priest of St.
Margaret&rsquo;s, in the <a name="page590"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 590</span>time of bishop <i>Spencer</i>, of
fighting, crusading, and persecuting memory; and that he was
afterwards suspected and found to be a <i>Lollard</i> or
<i>Wickliffite</i>, <a name="citation590"></a><a
href="#footnote590" class="citation">[590]</a> which meant pretty
much the same with what we call being a <i>protestant</i>, but
was then deemed, by the rulers, in church and state, a very
grievous offence, and even a most shocking, pestilent, damnable,
and insufferable heresy.&nbsp; The defection of Sawtre, from the
established or national faith, roused his ecclesiastical
superiors, and he was cited to appear before his haughty and
furious diocesan, at his palace of south Helingham; which
accordingly he did, on the last day of April, and the first of
May 1399.&nbsp; In the mean time he appears to have undergone a
long and strict examination, in the chapel belonging to the said
episcopal palace, before the bishop, the archdeacon of Norwich,
and divers others, consisting of doctors, divines, and
notaries.&nbsp; It also appears that he was then so far from
being ashamed of the opinions he had espoused, or intimidated by
the danger to which they might expose him, that he did not at all
scruple or hesitate to avow and defend them.&nbsp; This we may be
sure, did not please and conciliate his <a
name="page591"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 591</span>examiners,
or promote and facilitate his acquittal and liberation.</p>
<p>We are not particularly informed how he was disposed of
immediately after this examination: but it seems pretty certain,
that he then became a close prisoner in some place of confinement
within the precincts of the said episcopal palace.&nbsp; A
prison, for reputed heretics and other delinquents, was formerly
considered among the necessary appendages to a prelatical mansion
or residence: and it cannot be supposed, considering the
character of bishop Spencer, but that a very complete one was
then to be found at South Helingham.&nbsp; In a complete
episcopal prison there was usually, it seems, a cell, called
<i>Little-Ease</i>; which was a small hole, so constructed, that
the person there immured could neither stand upright, lie
straight, sit comfortably, or enjoy any degree of ease: in short,
it was designed as a place of torment, where the sufferer was to
be continually tortured, and deprived, as much as possible, of
every thing that could render his situation in any degree
tolerable or supportable.&nbsp; This diabolically ingenious
contrivance could scarcely fail of answering the purpose of its
inventors, as it seems to have been most admirably adapted for
taming, subduing, and breaking the spirits of reputed heretics
and religious free thinkers: few of whom, it is presumed, could
stand such an ordeal, or terrible test, for any length of
time.&nbsp; The romish hierarchy must have been tremendously
formidable, when its prelates had such prisons in their own
houses, <a name="page592"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
592</span>and were empowered to confine there any that dissented
from the church, or objected to its tenets and observances. <a
name="citation592"></a><a href="#footnote592"
class="citation">[592]</a></p>
<p>That there was such a place of incarceration and torture then
attached to the episcopal palace of South <a
name="page593"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 593</span>Helingham,
seems highly probable; and if there were, there can be no doubt
but that Sawtre was there confined from the first to the
nineteenth day of the month last mentioned.&mdash;That he
underwent some very severe treatment, in the meantime, seems
morally certain, as the remarkable change in his conduct, at the
close of that interval, cannot be reasonably or well accounted
for on any other ground or supposition. <a
name="citation593"></a><a href="#footnote593"
class="citation">[593]</a>&nbsp; On the <i>first</i> of May he
resolutely avowed and defended the obnoxious opinions imputed to
him, but on the <i>nineteenth</i> of the same month, the next
time he was brought before his judges, he appeared ready to
relinquish them all, and pronounce his recantation.&nbsp; There
is no reason to think that his opinions had now undergone any
change, or that he had become really convinced of their falsity
or untenableness; for he appeared, almost immediately after, to
be as fully persuaded as ever of their truth and
importance.&nbsp; It was evidently the state of his mind that had
experienced a change: his fears had got the better of his
firmness, and he no longer possessed that fortitude and boldness
which he had at first displayed.&nbsp; Torturing severities have
often made people deny their principles, and deny, or confess,
any thing that their tormentors required.&nbsp; On this ground
(and on no other that we know of) can we account for
Sawtre&rsquo;s change and subsequent recantation.</p>
<p>It was determined, by the bishop and his coadjutors, that
Sawtre should publicly pronounce his recantation at <a
name="page594"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 594</span>different
places&mdash;in order, perhaps, the more effectually to expose
and humble him, and so prevent his ever daring again to broach
his recanted tenets in these parts.&nbsp; They probably suspected
his sincerity, and were resolved to render their triumph over him
as complete as possible.&mdash;The obnoxious things, or
enormities laid to his charge were chiefly and substantially
comprised under the following heads&mdash;That the Cross on which
Christ suffered was not a fit object of worship&mdash;That it was
more reasonable to worship a temporal prince than that wooden
cross&mdash;That the worship of angels is unlawful, even more so
than the worship of holy or truly good men&mdash;That going on
pilgrimage is useless, and that vows for that purpose are not
binding, and that the money so expended had better be bestowed in
alms to the poor&mdash;That priests are more bound to preach the
word of God than to say their mattins, or observe the canonical
hours&mdash;and that, after the sacramental words are pronounced,
the bread remaineth the same as before, and so does not cease to
be bread, or undergo a transubstantiation.&mdash;It was a sad
time when people held these opinions at the risk of their
lives!</p>
<p>On the first two days, as has been already observed, Sawtre
openly avowed the said articles, and boldly defended them; but at
his next appearance, after eighteen days of close confinement and
severe sufferings, as we may reasonably presume, he seemed quite
an altered man, ready to retract all he had before affirmed and
maintained: which may be easily accounted for on the ground
before suggested.&nbsp; How many times, or at how <a
name="page595"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 595</span>many places
the bishop now required and obliged him to publish, or pronounce
his recantation, it is not very easy to discover.&nbsp; We find
it to have been done at South Helingham, and we are assured that
it was also done in the parish churches of <i>Lynn</i> and
<i>Tilney</i>, and in other places.&mdash;<i>Fox</i> has
preserved a curious document relating to this affair, being the
bishop&rsquo;s account of the whole process, drawn up by order of
archbishop Arundel, and transmitted to him, when Sawtre was taken
up the last time, and tried before him and his clergy, assembled
in convocation, at the Chapter House of St. Paul&rsquo;s, in
February, 1400, as they reckoned, but 1401, according to our
reckoning.&mdash;That account, or document is as
follows&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>Memorandum</i>, That upon the last day
of Aprill, in the yeere of our Lord 1399, in the 7. indiction,
and 10 yeere of the papacie of pope Boniface the 2. in a certain
chamber within the manor-house of the said bishop of Norwich at
South Helingham (where the register of the said bishop is kept)
before the 9. houre, in a certain chapell within the said manor
situate, and the first day of May then next and immediately
insuing, in the foresaid chamber Sir W. Chawtris, parish priest
of the church of S. Margaret in the towne of Lin, appeared before
the bishop of Norwich, in the presence of John de Derlington,
archdeacon of Norwich, doctor of the decrees, frier Walter Disse,
and John Rickinghall, professors in divinity, William Carlton,
doctor of both lawes, and William Friseby, with Hugh Bridham,
publike notaries, and there publikely affirmed and held <a
name="page596"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 596</span>the
conclusions, as before is specified.&mdash;All and singular the
premisses the forsaid William affirmeth upon mature
deliberation.&nbsp; And afterwards, to wit, the 19. day of May in
the yeere, indiction, and papacie aforesaid, in the chappell
within the manor-house of the said Henry bishop of Norwich,
situate at South Helingham, the foresaid Sir William revoked and
renounced all and singular the foresaid his conclusions; abjuring
and correcting all such heresies and errors, taking his oath upon
a book before the said Henry, the bishop of Norwich, that from
that time forward he would never preach, affirm, nor hold privily
nor apertly, the foresaid conclusions; and that he would
pronounce, according to the appointment of the said bishop, the
foresaid conclusions to be erroneous and heresies, in the parish
churches of Lin and Tilney, and in other places at the assignment
of the said bishop; and further sware, that he would stand to the
ordinance of the said bishop touching the premisses, in the
presence of the discreet and worshipfull men afore-recited, with
divers other moe.&mdash;As concerning the first conclusion, that
he said he would not worship the cross &amp;c. he confessed
himself to have erred, and that the article was erroneous, and
submitted himselfe.&nbsp; And as touching the second article,
that he said, he would rather worship a king, &amp;c. he
confessed himself to have erred, and the article to be erroneous,
and submitted himselfe, and soforth of all the rest.&mdash;Then
next after this, upon the 25. day of May, in the yeere of our
Lord aforesaid, in the <i>Church yard of the Chappell of St.
James</i>, within the towne of Lin, the foresaid William, in the
presence of the foresaid bishop <a name="page597"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 597</span>and clergy, and the people of the
said towne of Lin standing round about, publikely declared in the
English tongue, the foresaid conclusions to be erroneous and
heresies, as was contained in a certain scrole. <a
name="citation597"></a><a href="#footnote597"
class="citation">[597]</a>&nbsp; And after this, the 26. day of
May, in the yeere above said in the <i>Church of the Hospital of
S. John&rsquo;s</i>, in the towne of Lin, the said Sir William,
before the said bishop sitting as judge, sware and took his oath
upon the holy Evangelists, that he would never after that time
preach <a name="page598"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
598</span>openly and publikely the foresaid conclusions, nor
would heare the confessions of any of his subjects of his
diocesse of Norwich without the speciall license of the said
bishop, &amp;c.&nbsp; In the presence of frier John Smermen, M.
John Rickinghall doctor of divinity, W. Carlton doctor of both
lawes, and Thomas Bulton officer of the liberty of Lin aforesaid,
with divers others.&rdquo; <a name="citation598"></a><a

</blockquote>
<p>Such was the account, or statement of his former process
against Sawtre, which bishop Spencer delivered to his
metropolitan, Arundel.&nbsp; Not the least hint is here given,
how the reputed heretic had been treated, or was disposed of,
during the interval between his first and last examination.&nbsp;
Had his renunciation of his obnoxious tenets been brought about
by mere argument, or rational persuasion, it would, doubtless,
have been mentioned by way of triumph, or boasting: but having
been the effect of extreme severity or cruel treatment (as was
above suggested) it was very natural to pass it over in silence,
for it was not capable of yielding any manner of credit to the
parties concerned, or give them a plausible pretence to make a
merit of it.&nbsp; This silence therefore evidently and strongly
corroborates, if it do not also satisfactorily establish, what
was before advanced or suggested on this head.</p>
<p>After Sawtre had gone quite through this irksome and
humiliating process of recantation, it might be expected that he
would not think of tarrying much longer in these parts: he,
accordingly, appears to have quitted Lynn <a
name="page599"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 599</span>shortly
after, and obtained the situation of parish-priest, or minister
of <i>St. Osith</i>, in London. <a name="citation599"></a><a
href="#footnote599" class="citation">[599]</a>&nbsp; This would
seem to indicate, that his character was still deemed
respectable, and had not suffered so much by the late event as
some might expect.&nbsp; He had also, probably, some good and
powerful friends, who now interested themselves very warmly and
effectually in his behalf.&nbsp; However that was, he really did,
as far as we can discover, obtain the said situation without
opposition or difficulty.&nbsp; But he soon appeared to be so far
from having abandoned his former principles, that he was still,
in fact, as much a Lollard and heretic as ever: and his late
miscarriage seems to have operated so as both to confirm him in
those principles and also to arm him with boldness and courage to
maintain them against all gainsayers, and in the face of every
future danger or opposition.</p>
<p>Like that of the rest of his party, (the Lollards,)
Sawtre&rsquo;s heresy seems to have been of a twofold nature;
partly religious, and partly political; which must have rendered
him doubly odious to the ruling powers: and as he proved a
relapsed, confirmed, and irreclaimable heretic, we need not
wonder that he should be made to feel the whole and overwhelming
weight of their indignation and vengeance.&nbsp; The affairs of
this country were then, as at some subsequent periods, most
wretchedly <a name="page600"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
600</span>situated.&nbsp; Every thing, both in church and state,
might be said to be lamentably in the wrong: and Sawtre appears
to have been earnestly desirous of having them thoroughly
reformed and rectified.&nbsp; He may therefore be considered, if
not as the Sir <i>William Jones</i>, <a name="citation600"></a><a
href="#footnote600" class="citation">[600]</a> the <i>Sir Francis
Burdett</i>, or the <i>Major Cartwright</i>, yet, at least, or
rather, as the <i>Christopher Wyvill</i> of that time.&nbsp; Men
of that sort, though ever so honest, virtuous, enlightened, or
respectable, are always viewed with an evil eye, and deemed to be
dangerous characters by the interested and unprincipled agents
and abettors of ecclesiastical and political corruption.&nbsp; It
is no wonder, therefore, that a most horrible outcry was raised
against this man throughout the whole camp and borders of those
philistines.</p>
<p>Sawtre had formed an important plan for the benefit of his
oppressed country, and intended to lay it immediately before
parliament.&nbsp; The design got wind, and the high priests, in
particular, with archbishop <i>Arundel</i> at their head, were
instantly alarmed, as the project, had it succeeded, would have
deeply affected them: and in order effectually to frustrate the
reformer&rsquo;s object, they so managed, that the affair should
not go before parliament, but be referred to the
<i>convocation</i>, which was then sitting.&nbsp; From that
assembly no good could be expected to result.&nbsp; Patriots and
reformers were there objects of utter aversion; and any one might
see that poor <a name="page601"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
601</span>Sawtre had no longer any chance of bringing his project
to a successful issue, or even of escaping with his life.&nbsp;
He was accordingly brought before that ecclesiastical tribunal,
and the result will be seen by the sequel.&nbsp; This was about
the middle of February 1401, or 1400, according to their
reckoning; for they placed that month near the close of the year,
which, with them, ended on the 25th of March.</p>
<p>The story of Sawtre is thus introduced by Fox&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The next yeere after followed a parliament
holden at Westminster:&rdquo; [i.e. in 1400; for he has also,
like his predecessors, assigned February to the preceding year:]
&ldquo;in which parliament one William Sautre, a good man and a
faithfull priest, inflamed with zeale of true religion, required
he might be heard for the commodity of the whole realme.&nbsp;
But the matter being smelt before by the bishops, they obtained
that the matter should be referred to the convocation; where the
said William Sautre being brought before the bishops and notaries
thereunto appointed, the convocation was deferred to the Saturday
next ensuing.&nbsp; When Saturday was come, that is to say, the
twelfth day of February, Thomas Arundell archbishop of
Canterbury, in the presence of his councell provinciall, being
assembled in the said chapter-house [i.e. that of St.
Paul&rsquo;s] against one Sir William Sautre, otherwise called
Chatris chaplaine, personally then and there appearing by the
commandment of the aforesaid archbishop of Canterbury, objected;
that the said William before the bishop of Norwich had once
renounced <a name="page602"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
602</span>and abjured divers and sundry conclusions hereticall
and erroneous; and that after such abjuration made, he publicly
and privily held, taught, and preached th same conclusions, or
else such like, disagreeing to the catholic faith, and to the
great perill and pernicious example of others.&nbsp; And after
this he caused such like conclusions holden and preached, as is
said, by the said Sir William without renunciation, then and
thereto be read unto the said archbishop, by master Robert Hall,
chancellor unto the said bishop, in a certain scrole written, in
tenor of words as followeth&mdash;&ldquo;Sir William Chatris,
otherwise called Sautre, parish priest of the church of Saint
Scithe [Osith] the virgin in London, publikely and privily doth
hold these conclusions under written&mdash;<i>Imprimis</i>, he
saith, that he will not worship the crosse on which Christ
suffered, but only Christ that suffered upon the
crosse&mdash;2.&nbsp; <i>Item</i>, That he would sooner worship a
temporall king, than the foresaid woodden crosse&mdash;3.&nbsp;
<i>Item</i>, That he would rather worship the bodies of the
saints than the very crosse of Christ on which he hung, if it
were before him.&mdash;4.&nbsp; <i>Item</i>, That he would rather
worship a man truly contrite, than the crosse of
Christ.&mdash;5.&nbsp; <i>Item</i>, That he is bound rather to
worship a man that is predestinate, than an angell of
God.&mdash;6.&nbsp; <i>Item</i>, That if any man would visit the
monuments of Peter and Paul, or go on pilgrimage to the Tombe of
Saint Thomas, or else any whither else, for the obtaining of any
temporall benefit; he a not bound to keep his vow, but he may
distribute the expences of his vow upon the almes of the
poore.&mdash;7.&nbsp; <i>Item</i>, That every priest and deacon
is more bound <a name="page603"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
603</span>preach the word of God, than to say the canonicall
houres&mdash;8.&nbsp; <i>Item</i>, That alter the pronouncing of
the sacramentall words of the body of Christ, the bread remaineth
of the same nature that it was before, neither doth it cease to
be bread.&rdquo; <a name="citation603"></a><a href="#footnote603"
class="citation">[603]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>These articles or charges being publicly read and exhibited,
the archbishop then called upon Sawtre to answer to them; but he
desired that he might first have a copy of them, and that
sufficient time might be allowed him to prepare his answer and
defence.&nbsp; A Copy was accordingly delivered to him, and the
next Thursday was then fixed upon for him again to appear before
his judges.&nbsp; But on that day, owing, it seems, to the
archbishop&rsquo;s being then necessarily engaged in the
parliament-house, the business was adjourned till the next
morning at eight o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; The convocation, or rather
its upper house, being then assembled, Sawtre appeared again
before them, and produced a written defence, and answer to those
articles, which were then publicly read by Robert Hall, before
mentioned.&nbsp; He no longer thought of retracting, as he had
done near two years before, at Lynn and other places.&nbsp; On
the contrary, he now openly avowed his principles, and appeared
neither afraid nor ashamed to defend them.&nbsp; It is therefore,
not to be wondered that the writing, or answer, which he laid
before them, and which was now publicly read in their hearing,
proved no way satisfactory or conciliating.</p>
<p>After the said Robert Hall had read that paper, or answer,
aloud, in the audience of the Convocation, the <a
name="page604"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 604</span>archbishop,
being dissatisfied with the contents, proceeded to question
Sawtre on what he deemed the most material points, which chiefly
related to the doctrine of transubstantiation.&nbsp; Among his
questions were the following&mdash;<a name="citation604"></a><a
href="#footnote604" class="citation">[604]</a></p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Whether in the Sacrament of the altar,
after the pronouncing of the Sacramentall words, remaineth very
materiall bread, or not?&mdash;Whether in the sacrament after the
sacramentall words, rightly pronounced of the priest, the same
bread remaineth, which did before the words pronounced, or
not?&mdash;Whether the same materiall bread before consecration,
by the sacramentall words of the priest rightly pronounced, be
transubstantiated from the nature of bread into the very body of
Christ, or not?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To none of these interrogatories did the prisoner return an
orthodox or satisfactory answer.&nbsp; His answers being
therefore deemed insufficient, and the day, probably, too far
gone to <a name="page605"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
605</span>finish the examination at that time, it was thought
proper to adjourn the business till the next day.&nbsp; Of what
then occurred Fox gives the following account.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Then the said archbishop assigned unto the
said Sir William time to deliberate, and more fully to make his
answer till the next day; and continued this convocation then and
there till the morrow.&nbsp; Which morrow, to wit, the 19th day
of February, being come, the foresaid archbishop of Canterbury,
in the said chapter house of St. Paul in London, before his
councell provinciall then and there assembled, specially asked
and examined the same Sir W. Sautre, there personally present,
upon the sacrament of the altar, as before.&nbsp; And the same
Sir William again, in like manner as before, answered.&nbsp;
After this amongst other things the said bishop demanded of the
same William, if the same materiall bread being upon the altar,
after the sacramentall words being of the priest rightly
pronounced, is transubstantiated into the very body of Christ, or
not?&nbsp; And the said Sir William said, he understood not what
he meant.&nbsp; Then the said archbishop demanded, whether that
materiall bread being round and white, prepared and disposed for
the sacrament of the body of Christ upon the altar, wanting
nothing that is meet and requisite thereunto, by the virtue of
the sacramentall words being of the priest rightly pronounced, be
altered and changed into the very body of Christ, and ceaseth any
more to be materiall and very bread, or not?&nbsp; Then the said
Sir William, deridingly <a name="citation605"></a><a
href="#footnote605" class="citation">[605]</a> answering, said he
could not tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page606"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
606</span>&ldquo;Then consequently the said archbishop demanded,
whether he would stand to the determination of the holy church,
or not, which affirmeth that in the sacrament of the altar, after
the words of consecration being rightly pronounced of the priest,
the same bread, which before in nature was bread, ceaseth any
more to be bread?&nbsp; To this interrogation the said Sir
William said, that he would stand to the determination of the
church, where such determination was not contrary to the will of
God.&nbsp; This done, he demanded of him againe, what his
judgement was concerning the sacrament of the altar: who said and
affirmed, that after the words of consecration, by the priest
duly pronounced, there remained very bread, and the same bread
which was before the words spoken.&rdquo;&mdash;This examination
commenced at eight o&rsquo;clock in the morning, and lasted about
three hours: and as the prisoner would not now retract, or recede
from his Lollardism, and receive what was called <i>Catholic
information</i>, but chose to persist, at all events, in his own
way of thinking, the archbishop, as we are told, &ldquo;by the
counsell and assent of his whole covent then and there present,
did promulgate and give sentence by the mouth of Robert Hall,
against the same Sir William, being personally present, and
refusing to revoke his heresies, but constantly defended the
same.&rdquo; <a name="citation606"></a><a href="#footnote606"
class="citation">[606]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page607"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 607</span>After
passing the said sentence, an adjournment took place, till the
week after, when the prisoner was again brought before them, two
or three different times.&nbsp; On the Wednesday they read to him
bishop Spencer&rsquo;s statement of his process against him, near
two years before.&nbsp; The archbishop and divers others now
reproached him for holding opinions which he had before abjured;
as if it were a mighty crime for a man, after having been once so
weak as to renounce or abjure the truth, afterwards to repent and
embrace it&mdash;or, after having once been so overseen as to
resign the right of private judgment, ever any more to think of
resuming it!&nbsp; As all the stratagems and means they could use
proved now too feeble to shake him from his integrity, or induce
him to sacrifice his conscience to their unrighteous and infernal
pleasure, they resolved he should be forthwith degraded: and a
sentence of degradation <a name="citation607"></a><a
href="#footnote607" class="citation">[607]</a> was accordingly
passed upon him that same day.&nbsp; The execution of this
sentence <a name="page608"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
608</span>was deferred till the Friday following; and as the
archbishop could not then attend, owing to his detention in
parliament, it was further deferred till the morrow after.&nbsp;
They then proceeded to business in good earnest, and a most
curious process it certainly was&mdash;They first deprived him of
his <i>priest&rsquo;s order</i>, next of his <i>deacon&rsquo;s
order</i>, next of his <i>subdeacon&rsquo;s order</i>, then of
his <i>acolyte&rsquo;s order</i>, then of his <i>exorcist</i>, or
<i>holy-water-clerk&rsquo;s order</i>, then of his
<i>reader&rsquo;s order</i>, then of his <i>sexton&rsquo;s
order</i>, and finally, of his <i>privilege of clergy</i>: in
token of which his tonsure was erased, a layman&rsquo;s cap put
on his head, and himself so entirely secularized, or reduced to
the state of a lay person, as if he had never been in orders.</p>
<p>All this was certainly absurd enough; <a
name="citation608"></a><a href="#footnote608"
class="citation">[608]</a> but as it was also very curious, we
shall here give it more circumstantially, <a
name="page609"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 609</span>in the
words of the historian so often referred to in these
pages&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Upon Saturday, being the 26th. of February, the
said archbishop of Canterbury sate in the bishop&rsquo;s seat of
the foresaid church of St. Paul, in London, and solemnly
apparelled in his pontificall attire, sitting with him as his
assistants these reverend fathers and bishops, of London,
Lincolne, Hereford, Exeter, <i>Menevensis &amp; Roffensis
episcopi</i>, [i.e. the bishops of St. Davids and Rochester]
above mentioned, commanded and caused the said Sir William
Sautre, apparelled in priestly vestments, to be brought and
appeare before him.&nbsp; That done, he declared and expounded <a
name="page610"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 610</span>in English
to all the clergy and people, there in a great multitude
assembled; that all processe way finished and ended against the
said Sir W. Sautre.&nbsp; Which thing finished, before the
pronouncing of the said sentence of the relapse against the said
Sir William, as is premised, he often then and there recited and
read.&nbsp; And for that he saw the said William in that behalf
<i>nothing abashed</i>; he proceeded to his degradation and
actual deposition in forme as followeth.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Having thus performed their part of this diabolical work, and
delivered the prisoner into the hands of the civil magistrate,
&ldquo;the bishops, not yet contented, cease <a
name="page614"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 614</span>not, (says
our historian) to call upon the king to cause him to be brought
forth to speedy execution.&nbsp; Whereupon the king, ready
enough, and too much, to gratifie the clergy, and to retaine
their favours, directeth out a terrible decree against the said
William Sawtre, and sent it to the maior and sheriffes of London
to be put in execution.&rdquo;&nbsp; This terrible decree, or
royal warrant for the prisoner&rsquo;s execution, was obtained,
it seems, on the very day of his degradation, when the
convocation passed their final sentence and gave him up to the
civil power: so that there was here no time lost; and the closing
scene, no doubt, soon ensued.&nbsp; The royal decree, or warrant
was as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>The decree of our sovereigne Lord the
King and his Councell in parliament</i>, <i>against a certain new
sprung up heretick</i>.&nbsp; <i>To the maior and sherifs of
London</i>, &amp;c.&nbsp; Whereas the reverend father, Thomas
archbishop of Canterbury, primate of all England and legat of the
apostolike sea, by the assent, consent, and councill of other
bishops, and his brethren suffragans, and also of all the whole
clergy within his province or dioces, gathered together in his
provinciall councell, the due order of the law being observed in
all points in this behalfe, has pronounced and declared, by his
definitive sentence, William Sawtre sometime chaplaine, fallen
again into his most damnable heresie, the which before time the
said William had abjured, thereupon to be a most manifest
heretick, and therefore hath decreed that he should be degraded,
and hath for the same cause really degraded him from all
prerogative and privilege <a name="page615"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 615</span>of the clergy, decreeing to leave
him unto the secular power; and hath really so left him,
according to the laws and canonicall sanctions set forth in his
behalfe, and also that our holy mother the church hath no further
to do in the premisses: We therefore being zealous in religion,
<a name="citation615a"></a><a href="#footnote615a"
class="citation">[615a]</a> and reverent lovers of the catholike
faith, willing and minding to maintaine and defend the holy
church, and the lawes and liberties of the same, to root all such
errors and heresies out of our kingdome of England, and with
condigne punishment to correct and punish all heretikes, or such
as be convict; provided always that both according to the law of
God and man, and the canonicall institutions in this behalfe
accustomed, such heretikes convict and condemned in forme
aforesaid ought to be burned with fire: We command you as
straitly as we may, or can, firmely enjoyning you that you cause
the said William, being in your custody, in some publike or open
place within the liberties of your city aforesaid (the cause
aforesaid being published unto the people) to be put into the
fire, and there in the same fire really to be burned, to the
great horrour of his offence, and the manifest example of other
christians.&nbsp; Fail not in the execution hereof upon the
perill that will fall thereupon.&rdquo; <a

class="citation">[615b]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This memorable warrant (dated 26th. of February) was, no
doubt, speedily executed: perhaps the very day on which it was
issued.&nbsp; The death which it orders or appoints for the
alleged crime of heresy, or to which it devotes the reputed
offender, is supposed to distinguish it from all other warrants
that had ever been issued <a name="page616"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 616</span>before by our English monarchs: at
least, there is not known to have been here, previously to this
reign, any law dooming adjudged heretics to the flames.&nbsp;
Henry IV. therefore, stands preeminent among our sovereigns as a
promoter of the burning of those whom the priests pronounced or
denominated heretics.&nbsp; It is remarkable enough that the poor
lollards found such an enemy in him, who, as well as his father,
had long affected to be their great patron.&nbsp; But it was all,
probably, nothing but policy: neither father nor son can be
supposed ever to have been real lovers of either liberty or
justice.&nbsp; Henry&rsquo;s accession to the throne (to which he
had no right) disclosed his true character; and he has been known
ever since, as one of the worst of our princes.&nbsp; Arundel and
his brethren helped him to obtain and usurp the crown, in hopes
that he, in return, would help them in such affairs as this of
Sawtre: nor were they disappointed.&nbsp; They favoured his
baseness on that, and he favoured theirs, to the utmost extent of
their wishes, on this and on all similar occasions.</p>
<p>The execution of Sawtre was the first fruit of the new law for
burning heretics; and it was soon followed by an abundant
harvest.&nbsp; The number of those who were burnt for their
religion in England whilst this execrable law was in force, which
was near 300 years, was enormously great.&nbsp; As Sawtre stands
at the head of those memorable confessors, it was thought
requisite to be somewhat particular and circumstantial in our
account of him.&nbsp; The sons of freedom will venerate his
memory, while they detest and execrate that of his crowned and
mitred persecutors.&nbsp; Of our crowned demons none could <a
name="page617"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 617</span>well exceed
<i>Henry IV.</i> and of our mitred ones scarce any ever did or
could go beyond <i>Arundel and Spencer</i>.&nbsp; For Sawtre to
fall into such hands must truly have been a most sad and pitiable
case.&nbsp; It was like falling among thieves, or into a den of
hungry lions.</p>
<p>It is pretty remarkable that the prisoner&rsquo;s plan of
reform, or intended application to parliament was not allowed to
come at all under the discussion of the convocation; although
they had pretended to take it under their serious consideration,
instead of its going before parliament.&nbsp; But they knew
better than to have done so, and took a much shorter and surer
course to gain their point and effect the reformer&rsquo;s ruin,
by proceeding simply on a religious ground, and having him tried
as a relapsed heretic.&nbsp; So well did they know their
business, and how to avail themselves of all the advantages
belonging to their exalted situation.&mdash;We shall now take our
leave of them, and also of William Sawtre, whose memory we have
here endeavoured to rescue from oblivion.&nbsp; His being so
distinguished a character among the then inhabitants of Lynn,
and, especially, his being the English porto-martyr, will, it is
presumed, sufficiently justify and apologize for the unusual
length of this article&mdash;and as it exhibits religious bigotry
and intolerance in their native deformity and hatefulness, it may
be of use to those individuals among us, of every denomination,
who have not yet made any, or much progress in the christian
virtues of forbearance, candour, and liberality.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Alan</span>, <i>Aleyne</i>, or
<i>Allen of Lynn</i>, was, it seems a native of this town, and
contemporary with Sawtre, but a younger man, and long his
survivor, and so represented as flourishing about twenty years
later.&nbsp; He <a name="page618"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
618</span>was evidently of a very different cast from him, and
never gave himself the least concern, as far as we know, about
the politics of the time, or the <i>reform</i> of civil or
ecclesiastical abuses.&nbsp; Perfectly regardless of the
oppressions of the rulers and the grievances of the people, he
employed his time in poring over the huge volumes of the Fathers
and Schoolmen, and writing indexes to them.&nbsp; We are told he
made <i>indexes</i> to no less than 33 of those authors, among
which were Augustin, Anselm, and Aquinas.&nbsp; Such an
employment, though of no real use or benefit to the community,
procured him the honour of being classed among the eminent men,
or literati of that age; and his name has been handed to
posterity as one of the distinguished characters which Lynn has
produced.&nbsp; His skill and industry in making those indexes
might, no doubt, deserve commendation, but can hardly be said to
entitle him to any degree of literary celebrity.&nbsp; He may be
said therefore to have acquired more fame than was fairly his
due.&nbsp; But so it has often happened: while the merits of some
have been greatly underrated, those of others, on the contrary,
have been magnified beyond all reason and justice.&nbsp; Alan
received his education at Cambridge, where he obtained the degree
of Doctor in Divinity.&nbsp; He was of the order of Carmelites,
or White Friars, and therefore his residence here must have been
at their great house, or convent in South Lynn.&nbsp; How long he
resided there cannot now be said.&nbsp; We are told that he died
about the year 1428, and was buried at Lynn.&nbsp; The place of
his burial, no doubt, was the dormitory of his own convent,
situated on that spot in South Lynn now called the
<i>Friars</i>.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">William Wallys</span>.&nbsp; He
was cotemporary <a name="page619"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
619</span>with the last, and like him one of our Lynn friars, but
of the augustinian order.&nbsp; He was not, like the former a
mere reader, and maker of indexes, but a real author, and is said
to have written many books; but their titles and contents are no
longer remembered or known.&nbsp; They might be on interesting
subjects, and those subjects might there be handled in a
judicious and masterly manner; or they might not.&nbsp; However
that was, and whatever they were, it seems they have long ago
perished, like innumerable other works, no less valuable and
worthy of preservation; and, perhaps, much more so.&nbsp; But his
name, has been preserved, as one of the eminent Lynn men of
former times.&nbsp; How long he resided here, we are not
informed; but we are told that he died in 1421; and we may
presume that he was buried in the convent or dormitory of the
Austin friars, which stood behind the house now inhabited by Mr.
Rishton.&nbsp; He must have been eminent in his day, especially
among those of his fraternity, for we are told that he became
<i>general</i> of that order.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">John Baret</span>, of
<i>Barret</i>.&nbsp; He too was a friar, of the same order with
Alan; that of the <i>Carmelites</i>.&nbsp; He was a native of
this town, and educated at Cambridge, &ldquo;when learning (as
<i>Fuller</i> says) ran low and degrees high in that University;
so that a Scholar could scarcely be seen for Doctors; till the
university, sensible of the mischief thereof, appointed Dr.
Cranmer (afterwards abp. of Canterbury) to be the examiner of all
candidates in Divinity.&nbsp; Amongst others, he stopt Baret, for
his insufficiency, who then went back to Lynn, and applied
himself to learning with such success, that in a short time he
became an admirable scholar; and commencing <a
name="page620"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 620</span>doctor,
with due applause, lived many years a painful preacher at
Norwich; always making mention of Cranmer as the means of his
happiness.&rdquo;&nbsp; But we find that he had something of the
Vicar of Bray about him; for it seems he was at first a papist;
afterwards, in the latter part of Henry the eighth&rsquo;s reign,
and that of Edward, a protestant; again, in that of Mary, a
zealous papist; and lastly, in that of Elizabeth, a staunch
protestant.&nbsp; It seems, however, that he died soon after the
commencement of the latter reign: and one would hope that he died
in the true faith.&mdash;As to his veering or changing with the
times, where is the impropriety of that?&nbsp; Ought not the
ministers of a national or state religion to be submissive to, or
directed by the state, from which they derive their creed, their
revenue, their power, and their every thing?</p>
<p>The subjects of the foregoing biographical articles being all
<i>ecclesiastics</i>, and all the ecclesiastics of any note that
distinguished Lynn, as far as we know, during the long period of
which we have been treating, it might be expected that we should
in the next place give a list of the eminent <i>laymen</i> that
sprung up here in the course of the same period.&nbsp; But, alas!
we look and search for them in vain: hardly can one be found
whose name deserves to be recorded, or remembered by
posterity.&nbsp; William de Bittering, John de Wentworth,
Bartholomy Petipas, and Thomas Miller, four of our ancient
aldermen, were perhaps the most memorable, or notable that can
now be discovered.&nbsp; Of two of them somewhat has been said
already, and a sort of promise was made to bring them again under
review; but, upon <a name="page621"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
621</span>second thought, they did not appear to deserve so much
further notice as was then intended.&mdash;As to</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">William de Bittering</span>, we
learn that he flourished in the reign of Edward III. and was
chosen mayor of the town four or five different times; so that he
must have been here, in his day, a person of no small note and
influence.&nbsp; The first year of his mayoralty, it seems, was
1351.&nbsp; He was again chosen, and served the office the
ensuing year; so that he was then mayor two years
successively.&nbsp; He is said to have been again chosen in 1355,
but begged to be excused, on the plea that it was wearisome to be
so often in office, and, especially, that he was then under a
vow, to go on pilgrimage to a certain saint: from which it would
seem that he was, in his way, a very religious character.&nbsp;
His resignation was accepted, and <i>John de Coultshall</i>, who
had served the year before, was chosen again, and had 20<i>l</i>,
given him by the commonalty to take upon him the office for that
year.&nbsp; Bittering was again chosen and served the office in
1358, and again in 1365.&nbsp; The time of his death does not
appear.&nbsp; He was buried in St. Nicholas&rsquo; chapel, where
his grave is known by a flat stone of uncommon dimensions, being
above ten feet long and above six broad, and is supposed to be
the oldest sepulchral monument now existing in this town.
(Mackerell, 134.)</p>
<p>7. 8.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">John de Wentworth</span> and
<span class="smcap">Bartholomy Petipas</span>.&nbsp; They are not
here coupled or joined together because they were friends for no
two men could well be further from that, but rather because they
were foes, and the heads of two hostile factions, by which the
town was kept in a state of constant distraction for a great
length <a name="page622"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
622</span>of time.&nbsp; It seems impossible now to ascertain the
ground, or cause of that deadly animosity which those two
factions, or these two men entertained against each other.&nbsp;
Lollardism, we know, did then much agitate the kingdom, but we
cannot say that it was the occasion of this discord at
Lynn.&nbsp; Nor can we say that it was a mere political broil,
or, contest between the partizans of the episcopal feudal
prerogatives and their opponents, though this may seem more
probable, as it appears from pages <span class="indexpageno"><a
href="#page365">365</a></span> and <span class="indexpageno"><a
href="#page559">559</a></span> of this volume, that Petipas was
on good, and Wentworth on bad terms with the bishop.&nbsp;
However this was, it is pretty evident that these two were mighty
men and men of renown here in those days.</p>
<p>9.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Thomas Miller</span>, or
<i>Milner</i>.&nbsp; He was the leading man among our ancestors
in the reign of Henry VIII. being <i>governor</i> of the town,
and mayor also one time for four successive years; and he served
that office afterwards twice, if not more; so that he was mayor
of Lynn six or seven times, which is not known to have been the
case with any other.&nbsp; But what made him the most memorable
was his successful contest, or law-suit with the bishop, during
the former part of his mayoralty, about their respective claims
to have the <i>Sword</i> carried before them.&nbsp; This legal
decision established the mayor&rsquo;s independence upon the
bishop.</p>
<p>Having now paid our tribute of respect to the memory of our
eminent men of those times, we shall here close this chapter,
which brings us down to the era of the reformation.</p>

<h2><a name="page623"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
623</span>SUPPLEMENT<br />
TO THE HISTORY OF THE ROYAL TOUCH.</h2>
<p style="text-align: center">See page <span
class="indexpageno"><a href="#page326">326</a></span>.</p>
<p>Since the section on the royal touch has been printed off, a
paper has appeared in the <i>Monthly Magazine</i>, under the
signature of <i>I. Bannantine</i>, which casts some further light
upon that subject.&nbsp; As it is presumed it will not be
unacceptable to the reader, we take the liberty of inserting here
the substance of it.&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It does not appear (says that writer) that
any of the House of Brunswick have asserted this royal function;
at least, it has not been publicly announced, as was formerly the
practice: but were his present majesty to resume it, such faith
is yet put in the assertion of a king, that all the courtiers and
the great body of the ignorant multitude would not hesitate to
believe its infallibility.&nbsp; The last sovereign who appears
to have exercised this miraculous gift was queen
<i>Anne</i>.&nbsp; In the royal gazette of Mar. 12. 1712. appears
the following public notice: &ldquo;It being her Majesiy&rsquo;s
royal intention to touch publicly for the Evil the 17th. of this
instant March, and so to continue for sometime, it is her
Majesty&rsquo;s Command, that tickets be delivered the day before
at Whitehall, and that all persons bring a certificate, signed by
the minister and church-wardens of their respective parishes,
that they <i>never received the royal touch</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He further adds, that <i>Wiseman</i>, Sergeant Surgeon to
Chas. 2nd, in a treatise on the Evil, speaks of the <i>royal
touch</i> in the following <a name="page624"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 624</span>terms:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I have myself been frequent eye witness of
many hundreds of cures performed by his majesty&rsquo;s touch
alone, without the assistance of chirurgery, and those many of
them such as had tired out the endeavours of able chirurgeons
before they came thither.&nbsp; It were endless to relate what I
myself have seen, and what I have received acknowledgement of by
Letters, not only from the several parts of the nation, but also
from Ireland, Scotland, Jersey, and Germany.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was the office of Wiseman, as Sergeant Surgeon, to select
such afflicted objects as were proper to be presented for the
royal touch.&mdash;Is it possible (I. Bunnantine here exclaims)
to desire a more satisfactory testimony of these miraculous
cures, than that of a man of science and respectability, under
whose immediate inspection they were performed, and who had
&ldquo;himself been a frequent eye-witness of many hundreds of
cures performed by his majesty&rsquo;s touch
alone!&rdquo;&mdash;The late judge Barrington (he further
observes) relates what he heard from an old man, a witness in a
cause, with regard to this miraculous power of healing.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;He had by his evidence fixed the time of a
fact, by queen Anne&rsquo;s having been at Oxford, and touched
him, whilst a child, for the Evil.&nbsp; When he had finished his
evidence, I had an opportunity of asking him, whether he really
was cured?&nbsp; Upon which he observed, with a significant
smile, that he believed himself never to have had a complaint
that deserved to be considered as the Evil; but that his parents
were poor, and <i>had no objection to the bit of
Gold</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It seems to me (adds the judge) this piece of Gold, that was
given to those who were touched, accounts for the great resort <a
name="page625"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 625</span>on this
occasion, and the supposed afterwards miraculous
cures.&mdash;<i>Gimelli</i>, the famous traveller, gives an
account of 1600 persons offering themselves to be cured of the
Evil by Lewis xiv. on Easter Sunday, 1686.&nbsp; Gimelli himself
was present at the ceremony: every Frenchman received 15 Souce,
and every foreigner 30.&nbsp; This power of healing assumed by
the kings of France occasioned great resort to Francis I. while
prisoner at Madrid, by the Spaniards, who had not such faith in
their own king&rsquo;s touch.&nbsp; It appears by a proclamation
of Jas. I. Mar. 25, 1617, that the kings of England would not
permit any resort to them for these miraculous cures in the
summer-time.&nbsp; By another proclamation of June 18, 1626 it is
ordered that no one shall apply for this purpose, who does not
bring a proper certificate, that he has never been touched
before: the same, it has been already seen, were the terms on
which <i>queen Anne</i> granted her royal touch.&mdash;In a
prayer-book printed in 1703, is a form of the Church-service for
the occasion of the royal touch.&nbsp; After the Lord&rsquo;s
Prayer it is stated, &ldquo;Then shall the infirm persons, one by
one, be presented to the queen; while the queen is laying her
hands upon them and is putting the Gold about their necks, the
chaplain that officiates turning himself to her majesty shall say
these words following: &ldquo;God give a blessing to this work
and grant that these sick persons on whom the queen lays her
bands may recover through Jesus Christ our
Lord!&rdquo;&mdash;After some other prayers, the chaplain,
standing with his face towards those come to be healed, shall
say: &ldquo;The Almighty God, who is a most strong tower to all
them that put their trust in him, to whom all <a
name="page626"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 626</span>things in
heaven, in earth, and under the earth, do bow and obey, be
evermore your defence; and make you know and feel that there is
no other name under heaven given to man, and through whom you may
receives health and salvation, but only in the name of our Lord
Jesus Christ!&nbsp; Amen!&rdquo;&mdash;Mo. Mag. Mar. 1810.</p>

wide, and about 4 feet deep, beginning at the high grounds,
within a mile of Peterborough, and continuing it down to Guyhorn,
an hamlet in Wisbeach parish; and setting down a sluice across
the old river Nene at Standground, turned the waters of that
river down this new cut.&nbsp; This (he adds) with some other
works, said to have been done by him, did for a time make some
improvement in the fens about Wisbeach, so as to make them good
sheep pasture, &amp;c.&nbsp; But this (he further adds) continued
not long, being cut too shallow, and not sufficiently embanked,
or kept clear and free from impediments and

class="footnote">[19]</a>&nbsp; Bishop Morton was in his time one
of the most distinguished characters in this country.&nbsp; He
was a person of deep penetration, singular address, and sound
judgment; and possessed, in the highest degree, those rare
talents that constitute the profound politician and consummate
statesman.&nbsp; He was a warm and determined partisan of the
House of Lancaster.&nbsp; Richard III. rightly considering him as
too dangerous a person to be left at liberty, took care betimes
to have him secured.&nbsp; He was accordingly imprisoned in the
castle of <i>Bracknock</i>, where he was committed to the custody
of the Duke of Buckingham, then the said king&rsquo;s most
powerful and confidential adherent.&nbsp; Somehow he managed to
seduce the Duke from his allegiance to Richard, and engage in his
scheme in favour of the Earl of Richmond.&nbsp; The Duke&rsquo;s
ruin soon followed; but Morton escaped to the continent, where he
afterward joined Richmond, and with him returned to
England.&nbsp; After his victory at Bosworth, and elevation to
the throne, Morton became his most confidential servant and
counsellor.&nbsp; He was preferred to be Lord High Chancellor of
England, archbishop of Canterbury, and at last, a Cardinal.&nbsp;
He may be presumed to have been an adviser and promoter of the
most important measures of that reign; of which the depression of
the nobles, and elevation of the commons, were not the least
memorable or salutary.&nbsp; He died, before Empson and Dudley
came into employ; so that he had no share in their
malpractices.</p>

ought not to be forgotten that the said large accession of fresh
waters to the Lynn river, while it widened and deepened the
harbour, seems to have proved eventually fatal to a great part of
West or Old Lynn, which (including one of its churches and church
yard) was in time swallowed up by the waters.&nbsp; This, it must
be allowed, was a disastrous event.&nbsp; It is, however, an ill

church is gone, the income remains, which the incumbent still
duly receives, for nothing; for it is a sinecure, and not a very

before Denver Sluice was erected, Lynn Haven was in a very good
condition.&nbsp; It had two channels, one called the <i>East</i>,
the other the <i>West Channel</i>, in which the biggest ships,
drawing 13 or 14 feet water, sailed up and down on the neap as on
the spring tides.&nbsp; One John Attleson, aged 80, deposed that
for 60 years and upwards, he had known the river Ouse, and all
the rivers falling into the same; and that before the erection of
the sluices near Salter&rsquo;s Lode, all the rivers were free
and open, and received such quantities of water by the flood from
sea, that large barges with from 26 to 30 chalders did constantly
pass with great ease up to Cambridge town.&mdash;See Budeslade:

of Bays, Dyers, Dyehouses, Falling-mills, Button-makers, and
worsted-weavers at Lynn, with some thousands employed in knitting
stockings, &amp;c.&mdash;In behalf of the latter, a petition
against the worsted-weavers was presented to parliament in
1689.&mdash;See Town Book, No. 10.&mdash;Mackerell, about 70
years ago, makes the population of Lynn to amount to upwards of
20,000&mdash;if his estimate was right, even within 5 or 6,000,
(and he published it under the auspices of the Corporation) the
town must have been far more populous than it is at
present.&nbsp; See Mackerell, p. 93.&mdash;From the great, and
increasing number of empty houses now in the town, it may be
concluded, that its population is at this time decreasing.&nbsp;
The rapid decay of trade, the prospect of an endless war, and the
daily increase of the public burdens, are doubtless among the
causes of this depopulation.&nbsp; Neither the <i>paving</i>, nor
yet the <i>new poor&rsquo;s rate laws</i>, are likely to realize
the vast benefits promised or held out by the promoters of them,
and fondly expected by many of the inhabitants.&nbsp; On the
contrary, those very Acts are said to be severely felt by a large
portion of the householders, many of whom, it seems, have already
broken up housekeeping, and many more are expected to take the
same course.&nbsp; Upon the whole, it does not seem to appear,
either from the Registers of Births and Burials, or from any
other known circumstances or sources of information, that the
population of Lynn, within the last twenty or thirty years (as
generally supposed) has exceeded that of former periods.&nbsp;
This subject, however, shall be reserved for future
consideration.</p>

class="footnote">[66]</a>&nbsp; Of this undertaking
<i>Elstobb</i> gives the following account&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;That it was entered into by the Earl, at
the earnest request and importunities of the country in general,
who at a numerous sessions of sewers held at Lynn, January 13,
1630, became humble suitors to him to undertake the business,
which he condescended to comply with, and accordingly contracted
with the commissioners and the country, and engaged that he would
use his best endeavours to <i>drain</i> the said <i>marsh</i>,
<i>fenny</i>, <i>waste</i> and surrounded <i>grounds</i>, in such
a manner as that they should be fit for <i>meadow</i>,
<i>pasture</i>, or <i>arable</i>; and the work to be completed
within the compass of <i>six years</i>.&nbsp; To the end the Earl
might the more confidently undertake and effect the said work,
and be assured of enjoying the 95,000 acres, as the fruit and
recompence of his labours and charge; and that the country might
be more assured of obtaining a benefit proportionable to the very
great quantity of land they were to part with, it was agreed that
12,000 acres, part of the 95,000, should be presented to the
king, in lieu of all and every benefit he might claim by a
certain law of sewers, made in the 19th year of king
<i>James</i>, or by any other law or decree of sewers, and for
his royal <i>approbation</i> and <i>confirmation</i> of the
contract, &amp;c.&rdquo;&mdash;Having described the work in its
commencement and progress, he adds, that having expended about
&pound;100,000 these lands were so benefited that, in about seven
years time, from the first undertaking, viz. in 1637, at a
session of sewers held at Peterborough, October 12, the Level was
adjudged to be drained, and the 95,000 acres were, by six or more
commissioners set out for the Earl, his heirs and
assigns.&mdash;But it being soon after discovered that these
lands, though benefited, were not perfectly recovered, but in
winter were still subject to inundations, the very next year,
1638, at a sessions of sewers held at Huntingdon, April 12, the
Earl&rsquo;s undertaking was adjudged <i>defective</i>.&nbsp; The
<i>King</i> then taking the business into his princely
consideration, and understanding by an estimate made by Sir C.
Vermuiden, that if this Level of near 400,000 acres were made
<i>winter-lands</i>, it would be of extraordinary advantage, viz.
of about &pound;600,000 to the common wealth, his Majesty
determined to become himself the undertaker; and accordingly on
July 18, the same year, he was actually declared undertaker; and
was to have, not only those 95,000 acres, which had been set out
for the Earl of Bedford, but also 57,000 acres more, from the
country, it being his Majesty&rsquo;s design to make the land
good <i>winter-ground</i>.&nbsp; The Earl, in consideration of
the costs he had been at, was to have 40,000 acres out of the
95,000 before granted him.&mdash;The King to manifest his real
and earnest purpose of speedily effecting the business, caused
the following works to be done: a bank on the south side of
Morton&rsquo;s Leam, and another begun on the north side: a
navigable sass at Standground: a new river cut between the stone
sluice, at the Horse-Shoe, and the sea below Wisbeach, sixty feet
broad, and two miles long, with banks on both sides: also a
sluice in the marshes below Tydd, upon the outfall of the
<i>Shire Drain</i>.&nbsp; But the King being embroiled in a civil
war, the Level lay neglected; and the country complaining that
they had received no benefit by the draining, they entered upon
the 93,000 acres again, which had been taken from
them.&rdquo;</p>

applied, and the channel and navigation of the Nene considerably
improved.&nbsp; The interest of the money borrowed on the
occasion, was also for some years regularly and punctually paid;
so that the river Nene securities, as they were called, were
generally reckoned very good.&nbsp; Of late years, however, the
state of things has greatly altered for the worse: the river has
been neglected, and suffered to be filled up with silt and mud;
the navigation impeded; the interest of the money borrowed
between fifteen and twenty years in arrears, and the creditors
gravely told, that there is no money in hand for them.&nbsp;
Their case therefore seems to be without remedy and without hope;
there being, it is to be feared, no prospect of another chance to
restore or improve the said river.&nbsp; What is become of the

Marshland) and adjoining fens being little higher than the level
of the sea, or that of the rivers that pass through the country,
was once so exposed to inundations from floods and high tides,
that till dikes and drains were made, it was all one large
morass; and even now, after so much labour and expence, the
country is still liable to be overflowed by extraordinary high
tides or floods, or other casual events.&nbsp; By the evaporation
of this water, and especially by that of the water of the
numerous ditches, in which various plants and insects die and
rot, the atmosphere during the latter part of summer and autumn
is filled with moisture, and with putrid and insalutary
vapours.&mdash;Another cause of the insalubrity of the atmosphere
is an <i>imperfect ventilation</i>.&nbsp; As there are no hills
here to direct the winds in streams upon the lower grounds, the
air is apt to stagnate and become unwholesome.&nbsp; An
additional cause of the unhealthiness of this flat and marshy
country, may be the impurity of the water in common use; for this
being either collected from rains, and preserved in cisterns, or
drawn from shallow wells, is, in hot and dry-seasons soon
corrupted.&nbsp; This being the case, the general tendency to
putrefaction must be increased by the use of such water, as well
as by the meats, which in a close, hot, and moist air, are
quickly tainted.&nbsp; Several circumstances therefore in this
country concur in summer, not only to relax the solids, but to
dispose the humours to putrefaction; and as the combination of
heat and impure moisture is the great cause of the speedy
corruption of animal substances, so it is observed in every place
to produce remitting and intermitting fever.&rdquo;&mdash;See

name, as it is called, was <i>Lancelot</i>, seems to have been in
his day one of the better sort of the men of that order, as
appears by the following anecdote, related of him after he had
been translated from Ely to Winchester.&mdash;Waller, the poet,
being one day at court, while James I. was dining, overheard the
following conversation between his <i>sacred</i> majesty and two
of his bishops, of whom one was Andrews of Winchester, and the
other Neale of Durham.&nbsp; These two prelates, standing behind
the king&rsquo;s chair, were asked by him, &ldquo;If he might not
take his subjects&rsquo; money when he wanted it, without all the
usual formality in parliament?&rdquo;&nbsp; To which his lordship
of Durham readily answered, &ldquo;God forbid, sir, but you
should; you are the breath of our nostrils.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
other being silent, James addressed himself to him, &ldquo;Well,
my lord of Winchester, and what say you?&rdquo;&nbsp; Andrews
replied, that he was &ldquo;not competent to judge in
parliamentary cases.&rdquo;&nbsp; Upon which the king exclaimed,
&ldquo;No evasions, my lord, I expect an immediate and direct
answer to my question!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Then, sir,&rdquo; said
he, &ldquo;I think it lawful for you to take my brother
Neale&rsquo;s money, for he offers it.&rdquo;&mdash;It is easy to
see that there was some difference between these two bishops, and
that the latter was the better man of the two, being by no means
so lost to all shame and decency, or so abject a flatterer of
majesty as the other.&nbsp; Which of them the majority of their
successors have resembled most, may be a point not very easy to
determine: nor would it be, perhaps, of very material
consequence.</p>

indiscretions, contributed largely to the alienation of the
affections of his subjects from the king her husband; and she
suffered very severely in consequence of it.&nbsp; After her
retirement into France, that court, at the head of which was her
nephew Lewis XIV, is said to have been very remiss in
administering to her relief, so as to leave her often in want
even of the necessaries of life.&nbsp; It has been reported that
she was in such distress at Paris, in 1643, that she and her
infant daughter were obliged to lie in bed, in their room at the
palace of the Louvre, for want of wood to make their fire
with.&nbsp; One time during the Protectorate, as Granger reports,
she was so reduced, that she actually applied to Cromwell for
relief, as queen dowager of England.&nbsp; In 1660, after an
absence of many years, she returned to London, where she seems
not to have been treated with much kindness by her son
Charles.&nbsp; In 1665, at the breaking out of the plague, she
again retired to France.&nbsp; From Sir John Reresby&rsquo;s
memoirs it appears, that she was secretly married (probably about
that time) to Henry Jermyn, earl of St. Albans, who had for many
years attended her as chamberlain of her household, or some such
character, and who afterward treated her in a most unkind and
brutal manner.&nbsp; She died in 1669, in her 60th year.</p>

class="footnote">[219]</a>&nbsp; Before the introduction of
Christianity, the prevailing and established religion of Britain
and of Gaul, was Bardism, or Druidism, as it is more commonly
called, of which very different accounts have been given by
different authors.&nbsp; According to our best informed
antiquaries and most competent judges, it was of very remote if
not of patriarchal origin, and exhibited for no short period a
most strikingly rational and venerable appearance.&nbsp; It
taught the existence, unity, spirituality, and benevolence of the
Supreme Being; also the doctrine of a future state, of
providence, and the immortality of the soul: but it taught withal
the transmigration of the soul, and even the final salvation of
the whole human race, with other tenets equally grating to an
orthodox ear.&nbsp; Its fundamental object and principle were a
diligent search after truth, and a rigid adherence to justice and
peace.&nbsp; The religious Functionaries never bore arms, nor
engaged in any party disputes.&nbsp; They were employed as
heralds in war, and so sacred were their persons considered, in
the office of mediators, that they passed unmolested through
hostile countries, and even appeared in the midst of battle, to
arrest the arm of slaughter, while they executed their
missions.&nbsp; So far they appear singularly dignified and
respectable; but this did not always continue&mdash;like the
priests of other professions, they, in time, departed from their
original principles, and introduced various degrading changes,
especially among the Gauls.&nbsp; In Britain the system was
preserved in greater purity: hence the first families of Gaul
sent their children hither for education, as Cesar testifies.</p>
<p>We have often heard Druidism represented as a monstrous and
shocking system: but if it was so, it must have been in its
corrupt, and not in its original state.&nbsp; Even christianity
itself, in a corrupt state, becomes an object equally monstrous
and shocking; but that can furnish no argument against genuine
christianity, or the religion of the New Testament.&nbsp; As to
the <i>human victims</i> which the Druids are said to have
offered, they were, it seems, chiefly <i>malefactors</i>: in that
view we may be said to have our human victims too, and that in
far greater numbers probably, than those of the Druids.&nbsp; Our
executions are very frequent, and the victims we thus offer up
are more numerous than in any other country we know of.&nbsp;
These victims we offer up to law and justice, but they are very
few compared with the myriads upon myriads we have offered on the
altar of injustice, persecution, ambition, and folly.</p>

in conquered countries, and it is likely that such an important
undertaking as that of recovering and improving these fertile
parts, would be by them committed to colonists, such as they
might introduce from Belgium, who must from their habits and
employment at home, be peculiarly rated for the
task.&mdash;Circumstances also lead us to think, that the work
was begun here, which being nighest the inhabited parts, seems to
have been the right end, where common sense would dictate that it
should commence.</p>

were long distinguished from other nations for their piratical
propensities, and predatory adventures, as well as for the
success that generally attended their favourite operations.&nbsp;
It was no wonder, therefore, if their neighbours would by degrees
become attached to similar pursuits: and that it did so happen is
undeniable.&nbsp; &ldquo;In the ninth century (says a respectable
historian) it was an established custom in the North, that all
the <i>sons of kings</i> except the eldest, should be furnished
with ships properly equipped, in order to carry on the dangerous,
but not dishonourable profession of piracy.&rdquo;&mdash;So
reputable was the pursuit, that parents were even anxious to
compel their children into that desperate and detestable
occupation.&nbsp; By an extraordinary enthusiasm for which, they
would not suffer their children to inherit the wealth which they
had gained by it.&nbsp; It was their practice to command their
gold, silver, and other property to be buried with them, [see
Turner&rsquo;s History of the Anglo Saxons, and Edinburgh Review
No. 6. p. 368]&mdash;Here it may not be improper to observe, that
what determined the Saxons to piratical enterprises was a most
daring, singular, and memorable achievement of a numerous body of
their neighbours and allies the Francs, whom the emperor Probus
had transported from their own country, on the borders of the
Rhine, to the distant shores of the Euxine, with a view of
weakening the strength of that warlike nation, which was so very
formidable to the neighbouring Roman provinces.&nbsp; These
exiles, though removed to a country not inferior to their own,
could not bear the idea of seeing their native land no
more.&nbsp; There is what may be called a law of nature, which
attaches us to the region where we first drew our breath, or
spent our childish and youthful days, and which makes it often
most painful to think of being for ever separated from it.&nbsp;
So it seems to have been with those exiled Francs.&nbsp; Unable
to bear the thought of a perpetual separation from their kindred
and native country, they seized the earliest opportunity of
abandoning their appointed settlement, and regaining what
appeared to them the sweetest blessings of life.&nbsp;
&ldquo;They possessed themselves of many ships, and formed the
astonishing plan of sailing back to the Rhine.&nbsp; Who were
their pilots, or how they conceived, on their untutored minds,
the possibility of a project so intricate, and, for such
barbarians, so sublime, has not been revealed to us.&nbsp; Its
novelty and magnanimity ensured it success.&nbsp; They ravaged
Asia and Greece; not for safety merely, but revenge and plunder
were also their objects.&nbsp; Landing in Sicily, they attacked
and ravaged Syracuse with great slaughter.&nbsp; They carried
their triumphant hostility to several districts of Africa, and
sailing adventurously to Europe, they concluded their insulting
and prosperous voyage by reaching in safety their native
shores.&rdquo;&mdash;This amazing enterprise discovered to them
and their neighbours, that from the Roman colonies a rich harvest
of spoil might be gleaned by those who would seek for it at
sea.&nbsp; They had desolated every province almost with
impunity; they had plunder to display, which must have fired the
avarice of every needy spectator; they had acquired skill, which
they who joined them might soon inherit; and perhaps the same
adventurers, embarking again with new followers, evinced by fresh
booty the practicability of similar attempts.&mdash;The Saxons,
then inhabiting the parts about the Elbe and Heiligoland, are
supposed to be among the first to emulate the exploits of the
returned exiles.&mdash;Thus originated that system of piracy by
which the northern nations were so long distinguished, and for
which the Saxons were for many ages deservedly infamous.&nbsp;
They became by degrees so powerful and formidable by sea, like
the modern English, that some of the competitors for the Roman
imperial dignity actually formed alliances with them, in order to
insure their own success.&mdash;Like ourselves, and perhaps with
equal justice, they seemed to aim at the sovereignty of the
ocean: but among all their deeds of infamy, it is doubtful if any
one of them ever exceeded in baseness and atrocity our own late
memorable expedition to Copenhagen, though conducted by such as
made pretension even to piety and evangelism, which indeed but
rendered it the more detestable.&mdash;In vain we look to Algiers
and Tunis for more flagitious or fouler deeds.&nbsp; [See
<i>Hellfried&rsquo;s Outlines of a Political survey of the
English Attack on Denmark</i>&mdash;and for an account of the
expedition of the Francs, and the Saxon and northern piracies,

greatest and wisest of our kings, next to <i>Alfred</i>, had a
mighty veneration for relics, and even employed agents in foreign
countries to purchase and collect them for him.&nbsp; One of
these, an archbishop of Canterbury, called <i>Agelnoth</i>, being
at Rome, in 1021, purchased, of the Pope, an arm of St. Austin,
bishop of Hippo, for an hundred talents, or 6000 pound weight of
silver, and one talent, or sixty pound weight of gold.&nbsp; A
prodigious sum! greater (says <i>Granger</i>) than the finest
statue of antiquity would then have sold for.&nbsp; It may enable
us, as another historian observes, to form some idea of the
unconscionable knavery of the sellers, and the astonishing folly
and superstition of the purchasers of those commodities.&nbsp;
Enormous sums were then expended in the purchase of relics, and
the roads between England and Rome were so crowded with pilgrims,
that the very tolls which they paid were objects of importance to
the princes through whose territories they passed: few
Englishmen, as <i>Henry</i> expresses it, imagined they could get
to heaven without paying this compliment to St. Peter, who kept
the keys of the celestial regions.&mdash;Such was the wisdom, and
such the piety and christianity of the people of this country in
former times, and for many ages.&mdash;Even Alfred, according to
<i>Rapin</i>, was much attached to relics, and received, with no
small satisfaction and gratitude, those sent him as presents from
the Pope, and from Abel Patriarch of Jerusalem.&nbsp; His
foibles, however, were greatly overbalanced by his great
qualities, good deeds, and shining virtues.</p>

class="footnote">[250]</a>&nbsp; The reign of Alfred, however,
was certainly distinguished by numerous and important national
benefits: war and internal disorder were made entirely to cease;
learning, and the useful arts, revived and flourished; wholesome
and important regulations were adopted and introduced, whose
salutary effects are still felt; trade and commerce were much
encouraged and extended: in all which, and especially the latter,
Lynn, as may be presumed; must have been greatly
interested.&nbsp; Alfred employed skilful and adventurous
mariners, to explore the most distant northern regions, and (by
means of <i>Ofthere</i>, supposed to be a banished Norwegian
chief,) actually gained intelligence of the <i>Dwina</i>, on
whose banks <i>Archangel</i> stands; a river not again spoken of
in England, till 1553, when <i>Richard Chanceller</i> found his
way to the White Sea.&nbsp; What follows is still more
surprising: by means of a correspondence which Alfred engaged in
with Abel, patriarch of Jerusalem, he heard of a sect of
christians who lived in penury on the south eastern coast of
Asia, the present Coromandel; and he chose a spirited priest,
named <i>Sighelm</i>, to go and relieve those his oppressed
brethren.&nbsp; By what track or route this gallant adventurer
proceeded, any further than Rome, we know not.&nbsp; It is
certain that he reached the end of his journey, delivered the
royal presents, and brought back from India many curious jewels,
some of which were to be seen in the days of William of
Malmsbury, at Sherborne Cathedral, of which see Alfred had made
the fortunate and intrepid Sighelm bishop, after his
return.&nbsp; Others of these jewels are believed still to exist
in an old crown, kept in the tower of London.&mdash;After such
enterprizes, to celebrate this great prince as the <i>inventor of
horn-lanthorns</i>, may be deemed ridiculous; yet nothing can
less merit ridicule: there were then no Clocks in England; Alfred
contrived wax tapers of a proper length, to last one, two, or
more hours; and to prevent the winds from deranging his plans, he
defended the taper, with thin, clear, <i>horn</i>.&nbsp; Such
were the improved English <i>time keepers</i> of the 9th century:
the merit of which improvement, is due to Alfred; a merit not
inferior, probably, to that of the <i>Harrisons</i> and

for the solution.&nbsp; Of what sort they were, the reader will
be able to judge from the following <i>queues</i> and
<i>answers</i>; the former by the said missionary, <i>saint</i>
Austin, and the latter by his infallible holy master,
<i>saint</i> Gregory:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>Query</i>. 1.&nbsp; Are cousin germans
allowed to marry?&nbsp; <i>Answer</i>.&nbsp; This indulgence was
formerly granted by the Roman law; but experience having shewn
that no posterity can come from such marriages, they are
prohibited.&nbsp; <i>Query</i>. 2.&nbsp; Is it lawful to baptize
a woman with child?&nbsp; <i>Answer</i>.&nbsp; No inconvenience
can arise from the practice.&nbsp; <i>Query</i>. 3.&nbsp; How
soon after the birth may a child be baptized?&nbsp;
<i>Answer</i>.&nbsp; Immediately if necessary.&nbsp;
<i>Query</i>. 4.&nbsp; How soon may the husband return to the
wife after her delivery?&nbsp; <i>Answer</i>.&nbsp; Not till
after the child is weaned.&nbsp; <i>Query</i>. 5.&nbsp; How soon
after sexual intercourse, is it lawful for a husband to enter the
church?&nbsp; <i>Answer</i>.&nbsp; Not till he has purged himself
by prayer and ablution.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These nice and delicate queries, with more of the same sort,
were accompanied by others concerning episcopal
duties.&mdash;With the solution of these problems, the pope sent
Austin the <i>pall</i>, (a piece of white woollen cloth, to be
thrown over the shoulders, as a badge of archiepiscopal dignity;)
sundry other ecclesiastical vestments and utensils, and
instructions to erect twelve sees within his province, and
particularly to appoint one at <i>York</i>, which, if the country
should become christian, he was to convert into a province, with
its suffragan bishops.&mdash;Thus did Austin become the first
archbishop of Canterbury, and thus originated our ecclesiastical
establishment, the renowned Church of England.&nbsp;
[Aikin&rsquo;s Biogr. vol. 1.]&mdash;Among other counsels which
Austin received from the pontiff on the above occasion, was an
exhortation &ldquo;not to be elated with vanity on account of the
<i>miracles</i> which he had been enabled to perform in
confirmation of his ministry, but to remember that this power was
given, not for his own sake, but for the sake of those whose
salvation he was appointed to procure.&rdquo;&mdash;Thus we have
it from very high authority, that <i>the first archbishop of
Canterbury was a worker of miracles</i>.</p>

great lords and abbots, among the Anglo-Saxons, possessed a
criminal jurisdiction within their territories, and could punish
or protect without appeal.&nbsp; This power, he says, was in some
measure restrained by the established administration of justice,
by the courts of decennary, the hundred, and the county.&nbsp; In
the Anglo-Saxon courts, the accused was allowed to clear himself
by his own oath, and the concurring oaths of his friends.&nbsp;
These were called compurgators, and sometimes amounted to
300.&nbsp; The practices also of single combat, and the ordeal,
were allowed in doubtful cases; and absurd as they may appear,
the result was deemed complete evidence, for or against the
accused, or suspected person.&mdash;The punishment of crimes was
not less singular than the general proofs of guilt.&nbsp; A fine
was the customary mode of commuting the punishment of the
blackest offences; and as fines were a source of revenue, they
were fixed with the nicest care, on a graduated scale,
corresponding to the magnitude of the crime.&nbsp; Thus a wound
of an inch long, under the hair, was compounded for with one
shilling; a wound of the like size in the face, with two
shillings; and thirty shillings was the compensation for the loss
of an ear; and so on in proportion.&mdash;Mavor, 1. 77.</p>

daughter, or near relation to king Canute, and wife of Earl
Goodwin, is said to have made a vast fortune by dealing in
slaves; a traffic which then shockingly disgraced this country,
as indeed it has done in our own time.&nbsp; <i>Bristol</i> was
then, what <i>Liverpool</i> has recently been, the chief port to
cherish and carry on this detestable commerce.&nbsp; This
northern coast also, from Scotland to the Humber, was
distinguished on the same account.&nbsp; We are told, by William
of Malmsbury, that the Northumbrians used to sell their nearest
relations for their own advantage; and Dr. Henry says, that
English Slaves were then, like cattle, exposed to sale in all the
markets of Europe.&nbsp; Many of the Slave-merchants of that
period were <i>Jews</i>, who found a good market for their
<i>English and christian Slaves</i> among the Saracens in Spa in
and <i>Africa</i>.&nbsp; At Rome also, we read of English slaves
being exposed for sale, as early as the 7th century.&nbsp; It is,
moreover, highly probable that Lynn, and other neighbouring ports
were long concerned in the same odious employment.&nbsp; Even as
late as the reign of king <i>John</i>, the Irish used to import
many slaves from Bristol.&nbsp; To add to the brutality of this
vile proceeding, the Sellers always took care that the females
should be in a condition which might enable them to demand a
higher price from the purchasers.&nbsp; What put an end, at last,
to this horrid traffick, is said to have been, not the virtue of
the English, but the compunction of the Irish, who were shocked
at it, under the idea that certain national misfortunes which had
befallen them were divine judgments, for having been concerned in
so iniquitous a business.&mdash;Our unfeeling advocates for the
slave trade, who have so long dishonoured this nation, and are
still in no small numbers among us, are little aware, that time
was, when their own ancestors were in a similar situation with
the present inhabitants of Africa; being liable, like them, to be
bought and sold into slavery; and that other nations actually
traded here for Slaves, as we have so long done in modern times
to the coast of <i>Guinea</i>.&mdash;If they cannot put
themselves in the place of the poor negroes, and feel for them,
they ought, at least, to do so in regard to their own ancestors,
and so learn some degree of justice and humanity, if nothing else
can teach them.</p>

the present sovereign chose to revive it?&mdash;How strikingly
was the easy faith of the nation exemplified in the implicit
credit it gave to a late premier&rsquo;s possessing extraordinary
and plenary ability to heal all the national or political
maladies of Britain, of Europe, and of the world?&nbsp; And had
he pretended to a power to cure the scrofula, or any other bodily
complaint, with his <i>touch</i>, would it not have been readily
believed by all his numerous admirers, and by the greatest part
of our countrymen?&nbsp; And would not numerous witnesses have
soon appeared, ready to attest the reality and completeness of
his cures?&mdash;Circumstances seem evidently to favour these
conclusions: nor will the story of the <i>Dumb Doctor</i>, still
fresh in every body&rsquo;s memory, (not to mention other cases)
allow of our making here an exception in favour of the
inhabitants of Lynn.</p>
<p>For the sake of those readers who live at a distance from
Lynn, the affair here last alluded to may require some
explanation.&nbsp; Be it known therefore, that the empirical
Adventurer, called the <i>Dumb Doctor</i>, made his appearance at
Lynn about four and twenty years ago; and for a good while after
spent most of his time between this town and Wisbeach.&nbsp; It
was given out that he had been deaf and dumb from his birth, and
that he was a native of New England, or some part of North
America, where he had, somehow, (miraculously, or at least in
some very extraordinary and wonderful manner no doubt) acquired
very deep knowledge and skill in the healing art; and after
having performed great and astonishing cures in his own country,
had actually crossed the wide Atlantic out of pure kindness and
compassion to the sick and infirm folk of this kingdom, most of
whose complaints he might be expected capable of
removing.&mdash;The tale very generally took with our good
townsmen, and numbers of ailing people, gentle and simple,
well-bred and ill-bred, from all quarters, flocked to the
impostor for relief.&nbsp; Not a few of them also declared that
they had actually derived great benefit from his
prescriptions.&mdash;Thus he went on very prosperously, till an
old acquaintance of his unluckily came to town, blew him up, and
blasted all his hopes.&nbsp; He then suddenly decamped, and was
never since seen or heard of in these parts.&mdash;It seems he
had belonged so a company of strolling players, from which
honourable fraternity he had been on some occasion expelled: upon
which he took up the medical profession, pretending to be deaf
and dumb, and a native of North America, as was before
stated.&mdash;This may serve to shew that with all our skepticism
and infidelity, and our large stock of fancied light and
discernment, learning and refinement, we are by no means so far
removed from the easy faith and blind credulity of our ancestors,
or become such complete proofs against the wiles of imposture, or
the specious arts of daring deceivers, as might be supposed, from
our confident, loud, and boisterous boastings.</p>

<i>Game Laws</i> are not only exceedingly detested, by those of
the middle as well as lower orders, throughout the country,
(which constitute the major part of the nation,) but seem also to
be among the most grievous and disgraceful of all our present
laws.&nbsp; In no view can they be deemed respectable or
defensible.&nbsp; Nor is the conduct of our magistrates perhaps
ever more unseemly or disreputable than in the unfeeling, cruel,
and relentless rigour with which they put these vile laws in
execution.&nbsp; In nothing probably more than in this does our
present state resemble that of France before the
revolution.&nbsp; The Game Laws there were then intolerably
severe and grievous, and enforced by the magistrates with
unrelenting and diabolical rigour; so that they used to fill even
the very Gallies with their hapless victims: all which recoiled
with vengeance upon them and their abettors, the privileged
orders, in the dreadful change which ensued.&nbsp; Those laws no
longer exist in that country: but a recent traveller, (Pinkney,)
informs us, &ldquo;that though there are now no game laws in
France, there is a decency and moderation in the lower orders,
which answer the same purpose.&nbsp; No one presumes to shoot
game, except on land of which he is the proprietor or
tenant.&rdquo;&mdash;No where in England are these laws supposed
to be more grievously felt than in Norfolk; of which a popular
and respectable author of the present day speaks as
follows&mdash;&ldquo;What is denominated <i>Game</i> is very
plentiful is this county.&nbsp; The arable lands affording both
food and cover, and the gentry, being particularly attached to
the amusement of sporting, have recourse to the strong arm of the
law for its preservation.&nbsp; This tenacity on the part of the
landholders, producing covetous desires in the tenants, is a
strong inducement to poaching, and the source of numberless
disagreements, which too frequently terminate in suits at
law.&nbsp; Hence they are oppressive to one party and disgraceful
to the other.&nbsp; The various statutes, called &lsquo;the Game
Laws,&rsquo; are justly deemed the opprobrium of the English
code; and in no county perhaps are those statutes acted upon with
greater rigor than they usually are in Norfolk.&nbsp; The endless
litigations upon this despicable point have lately become the
subject of theatrical ridicule; and this county has on the
occasion been made the <i>butt</i> of dramatic satire.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Searchum, get warrants immediately, for seizing guns,
nets, and snares; let every dog in the parish be collected for
hanging to-morrow morning.&nbsp; Give them a taste for <i>Norfolk
discipline</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Happy would it be for the country,
if ridicule, as reason has hitherto failed, should be able to
induce the legislature to abrogate laws, which, as they were made
to support an assumed claim, can only be continued in force to
protect an usurped right.&rdquo;&nbsp; [Beauties of England v.
xi. p. 90, &amp;c.]</p>
<p>It is most disgusting to men of sound and liberal minds to
hear with what complacency, selfgratulation, as well as
selfimportance, the magistrates, at the convivial meetings of the
gentry, will be sometimes expatiating on the rigour of their
proceedings against the transgressors of the game laws, and
describing how effectually they curb and keep in awe the farmers,
and trounce to their utter undoing some of the most active among
the lower order of poachers.&nbsp; Such a conduct is nothing less
than a publishing of their own shame, and a boasting of their own
misdoings; and had they expanded and reflecting minds, or any
minds at all, they would blush for such a conduct, and carefully
and studiously refrain from it, as well as from all manner of
excess in their proceedings against poachers, many of whom with
their luckless families have been utterly ruined by them.&nbsp;
Some of those ill-fated culprits have perished in prison, after
long and rigorous confinement: one of whom, named
<i>Saunders</i>, died miserably in goal, after a <i>six years</i>
incarceration, who probably was as well bred as some of his
relentless judges; on which occasion the following lines were
composed:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;<i>Epitaph on
Nathaniel Saunders</i>, <i>gentleman</i>:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nat! thou&rsquo;st escap&rsquo;d just in the nick of
time!<br />
Thine was a barbarous and a bloody crime!<br />
How long confin&rsquo;d?&mdash;six years&mdash;that&rsquo;s only
fair;<br />
What was his crime? the scoundrel kill&rsquo;d a hare!&rdquo;</p>

excuse the repetition of this topic: he wishes all the different
orders of the community may be convinced that they are brethren,
and that those of the higher orders may possess the proper
feelings towards their inferiors, even of the very lowest
degrees, who though they have not so much at stake in these
perilous times, are yet of the very same species with themselves,
and so must be entitled to their tender and fraternal
attentions.</p>
<p><a name="footnote343"></a><a href="#citation343"
class="footnote">[343]</a>&nbsp; The same seems also to have been
the case in the recent continental conquests and changes: the
lower orders and bulk of the people appear to be gainers rather
than losers by those events: they were so burdened and oppressed
by the old governments, without any hope of redress, or the least
prospect of melioration, that they became at last quite
regardless who should be their rulers, and rather hailed than
deprecated the French emperor&rsquo;s successes and triumphs;
believing, it seems, that, if he became their master, their
condition, as it could not well be worse, would or might probably
be better than what it then was become under their own native
princes, who treated them, not as men, or beings of the same
species with themselves, but rather as beasts of burden, made
only for their use and service; and who were oftentimes disposed
of by them and sold like other cattle.&nbsp; Such was the abject
and degraded state of the lower classes and great body of the
people in most of the regular and old established governments of
Europe, before the French revolution.&nbsp; Had the rulers been
wise enough afterwards to conciliate the good will and esteem,
and secure the attachment of the people, by holding out and
granting to them what would be worth contending for, the French
had never been able to over-run every country and overturn every
government as, they have done.&nbsp; Emancipating the people, and
admitting them to the enjoyment of real freedom, would render
them a different race of men, capable of effectually defending
their country; and repelling any hostile attack or
invasion.&nbsp; But the statesmen, directors, and managers of the
old governments are not, it seems, to be convinced of these
obvious, salutary, and important truths.&nbsp; Instead of
adopting such a plan, they have too plainly manifested a
disposition to augment rather than diminish the burdens and
sufferings of the people.&nbsp; The consequence was natural, and
what might have been expected.&nbsp; But the managers of the old
institutions have not yet begun to learn wisdom from observation
and experience.&mdash;Even the pretended patriots <i>of
Spain</i>, who have made such fuss about their national liberty
and independence, have shewn as much reluctance as the rest, to
ease the burdens of the people, or ameliorate the condition of
the great body of the nation; and as they seem bent upon
perpetuating the old tyranny, and unwilling to avail themselves
of the only step that would give their resistance any chance of
success, their miscarriage and downfal ought to be viewed without
regret.</p>

referred to, consist of 1. a Letter from John Wentworth mayor of
Lynn to the king (Hon. iv.) dated on St. Martin&rsquo;s day 1403,
and complaining of the opposite party, as outrageous persons who
committed the most horrid crimes, and proceeded in the most
riotous manner against their opponents, with the intent to spoil
and rob them of their goods, burn their houses, slay and
dismember their persons, &amp;c.&nbsp; It is not the first letter
he wrote to his majesty, for he refers to others of anterior
date.&nbsp; Those however are lost, or we might possess a more
correct knowledge of this business.&nbsp; The <i>second</i> of
those papers is a Letter from Petipas, then mayor, to some of his
friends, complaining of Wentworth and his adherents and
<i>assentaunts</i> for troubling him in the discharge of his
duty, and requiring them &ldquo;be bille or be mouthe&rdquo; [by
letter or by word of mouth] to acquaint his reverend lord of
Norwich [i.e. the bishop] with the affair, and solicit his
interference. &amp;c.&nbsp; Its date is 1413, the first of Henry
V.&mdash;The <i>third</i> is from the same, and seemingly to the
same, and written, it is presumed, in 1414, the former part of
which was the latter part of his 2nd year, for he was then mayor
two years successively.&nbsp; The <i>fourth</i> was from
<i>Thomas Hunt</i>, who became mayor in the autumn of 1415 to
<i>Johan Spencer</i>, viscount de Norff. [i.e. the High Sheriff
of the county] and is dated &ldquo;atte Lenn ye tede day of the
mone of Juylet, ye yere of ye regne of King Henry ye fyft ye
ferth:&rdquo; which was <span class="GutSmall">A.D.</span>
1416.&nbsp; This curious paper complains of <i>Thomas
Felwell</i>, goldsmith, who had been indicted for his misdeeds,
as an instigator of <i>a rysing</i> and <i>ryot</i>&mdash;also of
<i>Thomas Hardell</i>, and <i>Thomas Enemethe</i>, &ldquo;and
very many of the misdoers resorten and drawen again in
counsailles to Barth.&nbsp; Petipas in sustenance of his p.
tie,&rdquo; &amp;c.&nbsp; It also offers the said Viscount, or
high sheriff, a <i>present of a young He-Bear</i>, which seems a
queer circumstance.&nbsp; But what makes this paper of most
importance, is its confirming, along with the other documents,
the very distracted state of the town at that period.&mdash;The
<i>fifth</i> is addressed &ldquo;to the lord bishopp of
Norwich&rdquo; (the above <i>John de Wakeryng</i> it seems.)
&ldquo;from his owen humblest tenants and devout Bedesmen, the
Mayre and good men of his town of Lenne Bishopp.&rdquo;&nbsp; Its
date is the 9 of March, the 3rd of Henry V. which seems to answer
to <span class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 1415, or 1415&ndash;16, and
the mayor was probably the above <i>Thomas Hunt</i>.&mdash;The
<i>sixth</i> and last of those papers was a royal injunction or
mandate from &ldquo;Henry (VI.) by the Grace of God king of
England and of France and lord of Ireland unto the Mair of the
town of Lenne Byshopp;&rdquo; and relates chiefly, as was before
hinted, to some irregularity or neglect in the choice of the 24
Jurats, directing and enjoining that they should be freemen and
lawful, and of the most discreet, sufficient, and <i>least
suspicious</i> persons of the said town; and each of them
possessing property in lands and tenements to the amount of C. S
(i.e. one hundred shillings) a year&mdash;equal no doubt to more
than 100<i>l.</i> a year now: also directing that in case any of
the 24 Jurats happened to die in the course of the year, others
equally unexceptionable should be immediately chosen in their
room, &amp;c.&mdash;As a sample of the style and orthography of
the magistrates of Lynn 400 years ago, and a specimen of their
mode of address to their prelatical lord and master, we shall
here subjoin the mayor and aldermen&rsquo;s Letter to bishop
<i>Wakeryng</i>.</p>

<p>In this lowly and abject manner did these humblest tenants and
devout beadesmen, the mayor and corporation of Lynn, of that day,
approach their high and mighty lord, bishop Wakeryng.&nbsp; They
were indeed his subjects and vassals, as their predecessors had
long been; and they might think that such cringing conduct became
them: but some of them would occasionally shew a disposition to
kick and resist, as had been the ease in bishop
<i>Spencer&rsquo;s</i> time, and also now, it seems, in the case
of <i>Patipas</i>, as well as of <i>Miller</i> afterwards, who is
said to have gone to law with the bishop and cast him.&nbsp; But,
in general, corporations, while they are some of the most
unfeeling, relentless, and tyrannical towards their inferiors,
are at the same time some of that most abject and obsequious of
all men towards their superiors and masters: hardly presuming at
any time to have a will of their own.&nbsp; They are as ready to
erect statues to bad as to good kings; and the premier, however
corrupt or flagitious, is pretty surf of being always their lord
chancellor, or keeper of their conscience.</p>

dictated the erection of those statues it may now be safely said,
that it was thoroughly vile and disgraceful.&mdash;What better
can be said of the spirit that was so predominant here during

all honest men who saw, deprecated, and reprobated his madbrain
system were held up to the contempt and derision of every
political coxcomb, and even to the fury of the populace, as
Jacobins and traitors?&nbsp; Time has already done something
towards justifying the views and principles of these persecuted
people; and futurity will do them still ampler justice.&nbsp; The
present generation is likely to be now soon convinced that their
politics, which have been so bitterly and violently decried, were
a thousand times more worthy of adoption than those of their
malicious opponents and revilers: and posterity will not fail to
exhibit in their proper colours the extreme folly and
wrongheadedness of the measures that this illfated country has
been pursuing for the last eighteen years and upwards.</p>

in this country, as well as very opulent, and continued so for no
short period.&nbsp; They were generally ill used, and sometimes
underwent the most cruel and base treatment.&nbsp; Yet on some
occasions, they met with different and better usage, and at least
what may be called the appearance of favour and
encouragement.&nbsp; The following instance is not a little
remarkable and striking&mdash;&ldquo;It will hardly be credited,
[says Andrews] that, in 1241, Henry III issued writs to the
sheriffs, ordering them to convene a <i>parliament of Jews</i>:
six from some towns, and two from others.&nbsp; The writs are now
extant.&nbsp; The Jews were proud of this; but Henry only meant
to plunder them.&rdquo;&nbsp; The last assertion if probably too
true.&nbsp; Henry was just that kind of man.&nbsp; It is however
very little known that he was, beforehand with Bonaparte in
convening a Jewish parliament or Sanhedrim.&nbsp; But the
characters of these two potentates are extremely dissimilar, and
so probably were their motives for convening the Jewish
delegates.&mdash;In the above mentioned reign of Richard I. the
Jews were most shamefully and cruelly plundered and massacred
here in different places.&nbsp; In the guilt and infamy of those
foul and horrid deeds Lynn appears to have been deeply
implicated.&nbsp; The tragical tale is related by <i>Parkin</i>
from William of Newburgh, and by <i>Mackerell from</i>
Hollingshed.&mdash;It states that one of the Lynn Jews being
converted to christianity, his brethren were so enraged against
him, that they resolved to kill him whenever they had an
opportunity.&nbsp; Having accordingly met him one day in the
street, they instantly fell upon him, fully intending to execute
their bloody purpose, but he escaped out of their hands, and fled
into the next church; they followed him thither, and breaking
open the doors, would have taken him out by force.&nbsp; Crowds
of the inhabitants, with a great number of foreigners, consisting
of mariners and others, who traded here, now came upon them,
rescued the man, and drove them into their own houses.&nbsp; The
townsmen refrained from any further acts of violence, fearful of
incurring the displeasure of their sovereign, who had taken the
Jews under his protection; but the mariners and the other
strangers followed them to their own dwellings, massacred them
there, plundered their houses and set them on fire, and
immediately taking shipping, escaped with their spoil.&mdash;Of
the truth of some part of this story some doubt may very
reasonably be entertained.&nbsp; It is not very likely that the
Jews should act as is here represented toward their converted
brother, as they could not be insensible of the extreme risk of
such a conduct.&nbsp; Nor is it at all probable that the town
rabble should refrain from assisting the strangers in the
massacre of the Jews, or desist from joining them in plundering
and burning those unhappy people&rsquo;s houses.&nbsp; These may
be presumed to be additions to what did then really happen, and
designed for the purpose of exaggerating the conduct and
blackening the character of the poor Jews, as well as throwing
the whole blame and infamy of the most shocking part of the
conduct of the opposite party on those foreign mariners and other
strangers who happened to be then in the town.&nbsp; It was
always the manner of the pretended christians of those days, to
impute some previous horrid atrocity to the Jews, in order to
blind people&rsquo;s eyes, and extenuate their own barbarous and
diabolical treatment of them.&nbsp; Upon the whole the plunder
and massacre of the Jews seem to be that part of the above story
which is unquestionably authentic.&nbsp; But Lynn was not the
only place in England where the Jews were then so treated.&nbsp;
The brutal and horrid work began in London, whence it extended to
Lynn and other places, even as far as York, where it ended in a
scene most shockingly tragical; the effects of which proved fatal
to the commercial prosperity of that ancient city.&mdash;See

further observes, that Lynn was famous at that time for importing
wine: and it seems that foreign wine was then very cheap here,
compared with what it is at present.&nbsp; Hence Parkin mentions
a pipe of wine as selling here then at 1<i>l.</i> 15<i>s.</i> and
a tun of wine at 50<i>s.</i>&nbsp; These were probably red wine,
for he afterwards mentions a tun of white wine as having been
sold for three marks and a half, i.e. 2<i>l.</i> 6<i>s.</i>
3<i>d.</i>&mdash;The mark being 13<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>&mdash;Wine
sells here now at a price above 50 times higher than what it did
at that period.&nbsp; Salmon was an article that appears to have
always fetched a high price in those days; and Parkin, in the
place from which these articles have been extracted, mentions
20<i>s.</i> as paid for 5 Salmons sent to the bishop of Norwich
at South Elmham, on Monday before the feast of the
purification.&nbsp; Ten such Salmons were then, it seems, as
valuable as a pipe of wine.</p>

<i>smock</i>, and our Lady and her <i>appearances</i> at
Thetford, some account may be found in Martin&rsquo;s History of
that town.&nbsp; Speaking of the church of St. Audrey, he says,
it was of but small revenue, but that a famous relique made ample
amends to the priest for the smallness of his stipend.&nbsp; He
then introduces the following extract from <i>Bacon&rsquo;s
Reliques of Rome</i>, fol. 181.&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In Thetford, a Mayor town in Norfolk, there
was a parish church, now destroyed, called St. Audrise.&nbsp; In
this church among other reliques, was a <i>smock</i> of St.
Audrise, which was there kept as a great Jewel and precious
Relique.&nbsp; The virtue of that <i>smock</i> was mighty and
manifold, but specially in putting away the toothach and swelling
of the throte: so that the paciente was first of all shriven and
hard masse, and did such oblations as the priest of the church
enjoyned.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Vulgar supposed this relique to be so full of sacred
virtue, that they ordered, in their Wills, certain persons to go
in pilgrimage to it for the salvation of their souls.&nbsp;
Margaret Whoop, of East Harling, had the following clause in her
Will, which was dated 1501: &ldquo;I will that another man go in
pilgrimage for me to Thetford, and offer for me to St.
Audrey&rsquo;s Smock.&rdquo;&nbsp; See Martin&rsquo;s Thetford,
p. 79.&mdash;Nothing is more probable than that this same smock,
in those days, drew many a pilgrim from Lynn to Thetford.</p>
<p>Of the blessed Virgin&rsquo;s <i>appearances</i> to divers
persons at Thetford, one was to a woman who had lost the use of
her tongue, but whom she cured the same time.&nbsp; The person
who asserted and recorded this was a monk.&nbsp; The same monk
has prefaced his account of another of the Virgin&rsquo;s
miracles at Thetford in the following notable and curious
manner.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I have thought proper to relate a most
remarkable miracle, because of its tendency to exemplify the
mercy of <i>God</i>, and to exhibit the praise of <i>his
mother</i>, and is most worthy of public attention; for whatever
tends to the Glory of God, and relates to his mother, is not to
be concealed or denied, but to be received as matter of
fact.&rdquo;&mdash;[Then comes the marvellous tale&mdash;]
&ldquo;William Heddrich, junr. carpenter, and Isabell his wife,
lived in a town of Norfolk, called Hockham.&nbsp; They had a
child 3 years old, who in harvest time was carried with them into
the field, as was customary with peasants who went to their day
labour.&nbsp; On a certain day about sun setting, the child
happened to be sleep, and actually fell into a sound sleep on the
edge of the field where his parents were reaping.&nbsp; In the
dusk of the evening, a man driving his cart along that side of
the field where the child lay, unfortunately the wheel went over
the child&rsquo;s head, unknown to the driver, and killed him on
the spot.&nbsp; The father of the child was following the cart
when the accident happened.&nbsp; He took the child up in his
arms, and finding him dead and besmeared with his own blood, he
made bitter lamentations.&nbsp; He then ran to an eminent surgeon
in the same town, who had healed many who had laboured under
various infirmities, by the sovereign efficacy of his
medicines.&nbsp; After the surgeon had minutely examined the
child, he found no symptoms of life; but he advised the father to
carry it home, and the next day prepare for its funeral.&nbsp;
When the father had heard the opinion of the surgeon, and was
convinced that he was deprived of his child, with heart full of
grief he look up the corpse and went to his house, and delivered
it to his wife, that she might lay it on the bed.&nbsp; Then he
assembled his friends and neighbours together, in order to watch
that night, as was customary before a funeral.&nbsp; Being thus
met they devoted themselves to watching, and with the greatest
ardour of devotion prayed to the blessed <i>mother of God</i>,
vowing that, if by her intercession the child should be restored
to life, they would go on a pilgrimage naked to the image of the
blessed virgin, in the church of the monks in Thetford, and there
make the usual offering.&nbsp; When they had made an end of their
prayers and vows, about midnight, the child revived.&nbsp; Those
that were present, when they beheld the happy effect of their
prayers, praised and blessed God.&nbsp; And, to perform their
vows, they took the child, and carried it before the image of the
blessed virgin, and fulfilled the obligation they had put
themselves under.&rdquo;&mdash;see Appendix to Martin&rsquo;s
Thetford, p. 83.</p>

present was that time when <i>three fat sheep</i> sold for
<i>eight shillings</i>, and <i>three fatted calves</i> for only
<i>eight shilling and ten pence</i>!&nbsp; The difference in a
great measure may consist in the comparative value of money, or
of the precious metals.&nbsp; They were then, perhaps, above 20
times more valuable, and less plentiful, than now.&nbsp; We are
told that the Jewish Solomon made silver to be in Jerusalem as
stone, and that it was nothing accounted of in his days: our own
Solomon seems to be in the way to bring things to the same
pass.&nbsp; But this is no sure indication of national
prosperity&mdash;Solomon&rsquo;s subjects, for all the vast
influx of wealth, were grievously oppressed and unhappy, of which
his unwise successor felt the sad and fatal effects.&mdash;The
dissolution of monasteries, expulsion of the monks, and
introduction of protestantism were long bewailed by many of our
country men, as very serious evils, and the causes of the
dearness of provisions, &amp;c.&nbsp; Their sentiments and
feelings they would often express in verse as well as prose:
whence one of our old popular songs had in it these remarkable
expressions&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I remember the time, before the monks went
hence,<br />
That a bushel of wheat sold for fourteen pence,<br />
And forty eggs a penny&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We are also told that about the time when those changes took
place, beef sold at a <i>half penny</i> a pound, and mutton at
<i>three farthings</i>, and that butchers then sold <i>penny
pieces</i> of beef to the poor, which weighed 2<i>lb.</i> &amp;
half, and often 3<i>lb.</i> and moreover, that 14 such pieces
were sold for shilling.&mdash;When the price advanced soon after,
it is no wonder that many would impute it to the late religious
changes, or previous ecclesiastical revolution.</p>

house 40 or 50 years ago, and is now occupied as a school room:
but we pretend not to guess to what Gild it belonged.</p>

Mosheim) allowed these four Mendicant orders the liberty of
travelling wherever they thought proper, of conversing with
persons of all ranks, of instructing the youth and the multitude
wherever they went; and, as these monks exhibited, in their
outward appearance and manner of life, more striking marks of
gravity and holiness than were observable in the other monastic
societies, they arose all at once to the very summit of fame, and
were regarded with the utmost esteem and veneration throughout
all the countries of Europe.&nbsp; The enthusiastic attachment to
these sanctimonious beggars went so far, that, as we learn from
the most authentic records, several cities were divided, or
cantoned out, into four parts, with a view to these four orders;
the first part was assigned to the Dominicans; the second to the
Franciscans; the third to the Carmelites; and the fourth to the
Augustinians.&nbsp; The people were unwilling to receive the
sacraments from any other hands than those of the Mendicants, to
whose churches they crowded to perform their devotion, while
living, and were extremely desirous to deposite there also their
remains after death; all which occasioned grievous complaints
among the ordinary priests, to whom the care of souls was
committed, and who considered themselves as the spiritual guides
of the multitude.&rdquo;&nbsp; [These Medicants were evidently
the Methodists and Evangelical Clergy of those days, and might,
for aught we know, merit the popularity which they had acquired
as much to the full as their successors of the present
day.]&nbsp; &ldquo;Nor did the influence and credit of the
Mendicants end here; for we find that they were employed, not
only in spiritual matters, but also in temporal and political
affairs of the greatest consequence, in composing the differences
of princes, concluding treaties of peace, concerting alliances,
presiding in cabinet councils, governing courts, levying taxes,
and other occupations, not only remote from, but absolutely
inconsistent with, the monastic character and
profession.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mosh. E. H. iii. 53.</p>
<p><a name="footnote498"></a><a href="#citation498"
class="footnote">[498]</a>&nbsp; See Mosheim E. H. ii. 412,
&amp;c.&mdash;Let us not think of reproaching the <i>papists</i>
for the absurdities of their Carmelites:&mdash;Our own
<i>protestant</i> order of <i>free-masons</i> can any day match
them in the ridiculous extravagance of their pretensions to high
antiquity, or empty and pompous boasts of a very remote and
dignified origin.&nbsp; Nor were the Carmelites perhaps in any
view less respectable than the said protestant order.</p>

enthusiasm exhibited by these missionary labourers, which amount
to a proof of their sincerity, must have eminently fitted them
for such hazardous services, and desperate undertakings as those
above described.&nbsp; Between those adventures of the
<i>Franciscans</i> and some that occur in the early history of
that truly respectable protestant religious order, or party,
commonly called <i>Quakers</i>, there appears a very strong and
striking resemblance.</p>

in her chapel on the mount, and this, might be the chief of

<p><a name="footnote508"></a><a href="#citation508"
class="footnote">[508]</a>&nbsp; In France they were called
<i>Jacobins</i>, from having obtained the house of <i>St.
James</i>, at Paris, for their principal church, or convent; the
identical place, it is supposed, which gave the very same name in
our time to a certain order of politicians, who used to hold
their meetings there, and who seem to have too much resembled
their former and stinted namesakes in the violence and
ferociousness of their tempers and proceedings.</p>
<p><a name="footnote511"></a><a href="#citation511"
class="footnote">[511]</a>&nbsp; Dominic now proposed to
<i>unite</i> the two orders, but Francis thought it would be
better to keep separate, but in perfect harmony; in which he was
probably right, as they would so be likely to act with the
greater energy.&mdash;For some ages these two orders are said to
have governed, with an almost absolute and universal sway, both
state and church, filled the most eminent posts ecclesiastical
and civil, taught in the universities and churches with an
authority, before which all opposition was silent, and maintained
the pretended majesty and prerogatives of the Roman pontiffs
against kings, princes, bishops, and heretics, with incredible
ardor and equal success.&nbsp; In short, they were before the
reformation what the Jesuits have been since, and what many, who
wear the mask of religion, are at this very day, even in
protestant states.&mdash;Much as Francis and Dominic might wish
their two orders to harmonize and powerfully cooperate, it seems
they did not always do so.&nbsp; There were occasionally some
disagreements and disputes between them: one of which is said to
have happened in 1243.&nbsp; The Dominicans insisted &ldquo;that
they wore a more decent dress:&rdquo; to which the Franciscans
replied, &ldquo;We have for the love of God embraced a more
austere and humble life, and are consequently more
holy.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; (rejoined the others)
&ldquo;it is true that you go barefooted, ill dressed, and girded
with a rope; but you are not forbidden, as we are, to eat flesh
meat, even in public, and to make good cheer.&rdquo;&mdash;It is
to be feared that there have been before now, even between our
own protestant sects, in this enlightened country, disputes about
points no less unimportant and frivolous.&nbsp; Another point, of
equal moment with the former, upon which these two rival orders
disagreed, and which occasioned the most bitter contention
between them, was what is called <i>the immaculate conception of
the blessed virgin</i>, or whether she <i>was</i>, or was
<i>not</i> born in original sin.&nbsp; The Dominicans took the
affirmative, and the Franciscans the negative side in this
curious controversy.&nbsp; It was carried on with the utmost
rancour, for ages, and the most scandalous means were sometimes
resorted to, by the respective combatants, in order to obtain an
advantage over their opponents.&nbsp; The religious, or rather
the papal world was long divided between those two silly
opinions, and what is worse, it was kept in a state of continual
animosity, each side looking upon the other with perfect
hatred.&nbsp; So usefully and commendably did these holy friars
employ their time and their talents, and such benefactors were
they to mankind!</p>

class="footnote">[512]</a>&nbsp; It is even said that he <i>died
with great marks of piety</i>: if so, it is to be hoped that one
of those marks was that of repentance, or deep contrition for his
many unworthy deeds; for it is certain that he had been, in no
small degree, a violent man, and a man of blood.&nbsp; He was the
father even of the horrid inquisition, an exciter of murderous
crusades against pretended heretics, and a prime abettor of the
shocking barbarities exercised on the hapless
Albigenses.&mdash;If he really repented of these execrable
misdeeds, he must have made a more hopeful exit than the renowned
reformer of Geneva, the premeditated murderer of Servetus appears
to have done.</p>

class="footnote">[526b]</a>&nbsp; Very few, perhaps, if any,
could be named of our religious orders, or christian sects but
what have done some good in the world, and as few, probably, that
have not also done harm.&nbsp; In estimating the character of a
religious order, sect, or party, we are apt, as it is very
natural, to set the one against the other: in doing which it too
often becomes a matter of doubt, which of the two, the good or
the harm, preponderates, or exceeds in quantity.&nbsp; When that
happens, which is much less seldom than one could wish, it is a
sad painful case.&nbsp; In our own country, at this time, the
diversity of religious sects and parties is very great.&nbsp;
Some of them are vastly popular, and others otherwise.&nbsp; Much
do we daily hear of the exemplary zeal, and the laudable,
persevering, and successful exertions of those who assume the
name of <i>orthodox</i> and <i>evangelical</i>, both in the
establishment and out of it.&nbsp; These reports seem generally
well founded.&nbsp; Much <i>good</i>, no doubt, has been done:
and we may venture to add, much <i>harm</i> also.&nbsp; The great
error of these zealous religionists lies in their spirit, or
rather in their not knowing what manner of spirit they are of,
which is evidently not the spirit of Christ.&nbsp; All who cannot
pronounce their <i>Shibboleth</i>, they teach their converts to
view with an evil eye: and all who go about to do good in the
name of Christ, they are sure to forbid or revile, and so render
all their benevolent endeavours useless, as far as lies in them,
<i>if they follow them not</i>, or are not of their party.&nbsp;
They may perhaps plead <i>apostolical example</i>, but it is not
countenanced, but expressly condemned by Christ, who enjoins a
very different sort of conduct.&nbsp; Until they therefore think
proper to comply with that injunction of his, they will have no
reason to boast of the excellence, or <i>evangelicalness of</i>
their spirit.&nbsp; [see Mark 9.39.&nbsp; Luke 9. 50.]&nbsp; All
religious sects and parties, would do well to consider, that the
spirit they are of, is what always forms the most important and
decisive part of their character.&mdash;More of this when we come
to the present religious state of Lynn.</p>

<p>Besides repairs and other contingencies.&nbsp; [See Mr.
King&rsquo;s MS. and Mackerell.]</p>
<p>From the above period to the present time, the weekly
allowance to the master and sisters has been gradually advancing,
but not in proportion to the advance in the price of the
necessaries of life; at least not so during the present reign,
and especially this latter part of it.&nbsp; For the last fifty
years the weekly allowance of the sisters, has been from
3<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i> of 4<i>s.</i> to 5<i>s.</i> till the
commencement of the present year [1810] when it was advanced from
5<i>s.</i> to 7<i>s.</i> and the master&rsquo;s allowance from
7<i>s.</i> to 10<i>s.</i>&mdash;This pleasing change in the
situation of these pensioners has been ascribed to the laudable
and humane exertions of the present acting governor and
treasurer, <i>Edmund Rolfe Elsden Esq.</i>, who is supposed to
have acquitted himself, in this situation, more respectably and
commendably than any of his predecessors, for the last fifty
years at least.&nbsp; Besides advancing the weekly allowance of
the pensioners, he has also put the hospital itself and premises
in a state of thorough repair, at the expence of 400<i>l.</i> or
more.&nbsp; All this he has been enabled to accomplish by
advancing the rent of the lands according to their present value:
and it is expected that he will be able soon to make an
additional augmentation to the weekly allowance and comforts of
the poor pensioners, whose concerns he so laudably
superintends.&nbsp; Till he was appointed to this situation their
condition was very miserable, and every year getting worse and
worse, with little or no hope of amendment.&nbsp; In short,
Alderman Elsden, in the character of acting governor and
treasurer of our Magdalen Hospital, has deserved well, not only
of the pensioners of that home, but also of the public at
large.&nbsp; His successors it is hoped will not fail to profit
by his praiseworthy examples and it is to be wished that the
managers of all similar charities would make a point of acting in
like manner.&nbsp; Very different, indeed, by all accounts, has
been the conduct of too many, if not of most of those entrusted
with the superintendence and management of our charitable
institutions throughout the kingdom, by which they have proved
themselves utterly unworthy of the confidence reposed in them,
and rendered their very names and memories detestable in the eyes
of all honest men.</p>

speaking of the Red Mount, gives the following account of the
said king&rsquo;s visit to this place&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;When Edw. IV. and his brother, the duke of
Gloster, fled before the great earl of Warwick, on passing the
Washes in Lincolnshire, at an improper time, they lost their
baggage and money; and arriving at Lynn, October 2. 1470, [other
accounts say 1469] lodged one night in this building, which the
historian erroneously calls a <i>castle</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; [But
the historian was, perhaps, more correct than his corrector.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="footnote555a"></a><a href="#citation555a"
class="footnote">[555a]</a>&nbsp; But though the said chapel is
confessedly an ecclesiastical structure, there might be once
about it erections of a military, or castellated character, which
would account for its obtaining the name of a <i>castle</i>.</p>

p. 294.</p>
<p><a name="footnote556"></a><a href="#citation556"
class="footnote">[556]</a>&nbsp; &ldquo;What led to the great
celebrity which this place obtained for centuries, was the widow
lady of <i>Ricoldie Faverches</i> founding, about 1061, a small
<i>chapel</i> in honour of the virgin Mary, similar to the Sancta
Casa, at Nazareth.&nbsp; Her son confirmed the endowments, made
an additional foundation of a <i>Priory</i> for Augustine canons,
and erected a <i>conventual church</i>.&nbsp; At the dissolution,
the annual revenues of the monastery were valued, according to
Speed, at 446<i>l.</i> 14<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i>&nbsp; That its
wealth should have been immensely great, is not surprising, when
the fame of the image of our Lady of Walsingham is taken into the
account; for it was as much frequented, if not more, than the
shrine of St. Thomas a Becket, at Canterbury.&nbsp; Foreigners of
all nations came thither on pilgrimage; many kings and queens of
England also paid their devoirs to it; so that the number and
quality of her devotees appeared to equal those of the Lady of
Loretto, in Italy.&mdash;The celebrated Erasmus represents it as
a place of such transcendent splendor as would lead one to
suppose it the seat of the gods.&nbsp; The monks had contrived to
persuade many, that the <i>galaxy</i> in the heavens was a
miraculous indication of the <i>way</i> to this place: hence that
was called <i>Walsingham Way</i>.&rdquo;&mdash;See Beaut. Engl.
xi. 313.</p>
<p><a name="footnote558"></a><a href="#citation558"
class="footnote">[558]</a>&nbsp; Having again touched on the
subject of the Gilds, the author begs leave here to correct an
inaccuracy or error that escaped him in mentioning St.
Ethelred&rsquo;s Gild at page <span class="indexpageno"><a
href="#page439">439</a></span>.&nbsp; It now appears to him that
this fraternity took its name from a female personage, named
<i>St. Etheldreda</i>; and he has, since the above page was
printed off, observed the following notice of it in Parkin
(134.)&mdash;&ldquo;John Alcock, bishop of Ely, June 3, 1490,
granted 40 days pardon, or indulgence, to all the brethren and
sisters of the guild of St. Etheldreda, in St. Nicholas&rsquo;s
chapel of Lynn, at the altar of St. Etheldreda the most holy
virgin, there founded, and to all who should hear mass at the
said altar, and to all who said <i>quinquies</i> before the said
altar, the Lord&rsquo;s prayer and the Salutation
<i>quinquies</i>.&nbsp; <i>Reg. Alc. Ep. El.</i>&rdquo;&mdash;So
great, in the said bishop&rsquo;s time, was the encouragement to
enter into St. Etheldreda&rsquo;s Gild, and to hear mass at her
altar, or say <i>quinquies</i> before it!</p>
<p><a name="footnote559"></a><a href="#citation559"
class="footnote">[559]</a>&nbsp; Some have thought that the
bishop&rsquo;s town house stood by the Fort, and that the said
stones might belong to that edifice, which must be a mistake, as
it appears, from old records, that that house stood by St.
Nicholas&rsquo;s chapel <i>to the west</i>, which must be about
where Dr. Redferne or Mr. T. Allen&rsquo;s house now
stands.&mdash;That the bishop had a house here in the time of
Henry III. appears, according to Parkin, from <i>Plita Corona
apd. Lenn</i>, 41 of that reign.&nbsp; &ldquo;This same house
seems to be alluded to afterwards, in <i>Plita Assis. Norw.</i>
4. Hen. IV. when it was found, that John Wentworth, mayor of
Lenne Episcopi, and the commonalty, had unjustly disseized Henry,
bishop of Norwich, of his free tenement here, 100 acres of land,
and 20 acres of pasture, he being seized of it in right of his
church,&rdquo; &amp;c.&nbsp; From this it would appear, that
Wentworth was not on good terms with the said bishop, which may
account for his competitor, Pettipas, advising his friends to
seek his lordship&rsquo;s interference; and it appears from his
Letters, that the bishop was favourable to him and, hostile to
Wentworth.&mdash;Parkin 155.&mdash;also Mr. K&rsquo;s MS.</p>

anterior to the date of the above deed, as we learn from
Mackerell, &ldquo;several gentlemen came to Lynn, and would have
taken the state of St. James&rsquo;s church, by order of the
Councils Letters, but were opposed and resisted by the
corporation.&rdquo;&nbsp; But if they actually came by the
authority of the privy council, as the above seems to imply, it
must be rather odd that the corporation should venture to oppose
and resist them: but so it is said, see Mackerell 227.&mdash;The
same writer says, p. 177, that in 1567 <i>the pinnacle</i> of St.
James&rsquo;s chapel, (by which we may suppose he meant the
<i>spire</i> of it,) &ldquo;was taken down, and the steeple built
flat.&rdquo;&nbsp; So that the tower appears to have been left

score last year, and are supposed to be more now.&nbsp; This is
said to have already occasioned to our Lynn house-owners a loss
of above 1000<i>l.</i> a year: of course, they have no great

salutary or beneficial effects of the new poor and paving
laws.</p>
<p><a name="footnote576a"></a><a href="#citation576a"
class="footnote">[576a]</a>&nbsp; Lynn, unquestionably, owes much
of its present declension to the new <i>poor</i> and
<i>paving</i> laws, which have so greatly added to those burdens
which were already become almost unbearable: they therefore ought
not to have been brought forward at such a time; especially as
they were disapproved by a large proportion of the
inhabitants.&nbsp; Though their bad effects are visible to the
most superficial observer, yet that avails nothing: we are too
self-sufficient to be taught by experience, or to let the
remembrance of past errors correct our future conduct.&nbsp; The
present sudden advance, or augmentation of the <i>water-rent</i>,
at the rate of fifty per cent, may serve to illustrate
this.&nbsp; Under our present circumstances, this measure must
appear exceedingly inconsiderate, unfeeling, and illtimed.&nbsp;
It would not have been disreputable in the managers of this
concern to pay the inhabitants the compliment of explaining to
them the reason of this measure: but, perhaps, they might think
that the inhabitants had no light to know the reason, nor yet the
reasonableness of their exactions.&nbsp; Private householders are
to be charged higher than shopkeepers: this also seems to want
explanation.&nbsp; Were we possessed of the whole secret, it
would probably appear that abuses exist in the management of our
waterworks not very dissimilar to those of our work-house.</p>

than the poor in all other English work-houses, or even better
than what many of those that contribute towards their support can
afford to do; which yet seems to be actually the case at Lynn, of
late years.&nbsp; Much tender attention, undoubtedly, is due, not
only to those of the poor who are entitled to parochial relief,
but also to those of them on whom a contribution beyond their
power is levied towards that relief.&nbsp; Of these there is said
to be now among us no small number.</p>

to less than 30.</p>
<p><a name="footnote581c"></a><a href="#citation581c"
class="footnote">[581c]</a>&nbsp; The expectation of the adoption
of a thorough economical system, for our Workhouse, has
considerably lowered, with some people, since the recent
appointment of a new collector of poor rates; when a person was
appointed with a salary of 130<i>l.</i> a year, although another
candidate, of equally unexceptionable character offered, as it is
said, to execute the office for 50<i>l.</i> less.&nbsp; This,
indeed, does not seem to be a good omen; yet we hope it does not
augur, or absolutely indicate that things will still go on after
the old sort, so as to admit of such vile and infamous
proceedings as those of the <i>flour-merchants</i>, mentioned by
Mr. Grisenthwaite, or that the expenditure of the next and
succeeding years will equal, or nearly equal, that of the last
and preceding ones.&mdash;No longer, it is to be hoped, are we to
hear of &ldquo;every thing for the use of the House being
procured of whom and in such quantities as the governor and
master think proper, <i>at the full current market
prices</i>&mdash;or, that groceries are taken, in small
quantities, <i>at the common retail rates</i>&mdash;or, that
<i>clothing</i> provided for the house <i>costs upwards of</i> 30
<i>per Cent. more them it might fairly be afforded
at</i>&mdash;or, that <i>our female paupers</i>, on holidays, are
to be seen associated, in the vilest ale-houses, with the very
dregs of society, manifesting by their lewdness of expression,
immodest demeanour, and depraved sentiment, an entire dereliction
of every virtuous principle.&rdquo;&nbsp; This last circumstance
must have actually reduced our poor-house to a
<i>wh&mdash;house</i>! a character which, sorely it ought no
longer to retain; otherwise a great part of our enormous poor
rates will be most infamously misapplied.&mdash;It is presumed it
will also be very desirable that <i>our new collector</i> should
not tenaciously imitate every part of the conduct of <i>his
predecessor</i>; and especially that of harassing the poorer
householders, for default of prompt or speedy payment, by
indiscriminately issuing <i>summonses</i>, at the rate of
2<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> a piece, and by three and four score at a
time.&nbsp; Such a process must bear very hard upon those
luckless people, whose poverty or inability constitutes perhaps,
the whole of their delinquency.&nbsp; To exact, therefore, an
additional 2<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> from each of them, must have
been, to say the least of it, an unchristian and inhuman
deed.&mdash;N.B. The <i>Collector</i> above mentioned, with a
salary of 130<i>l.</i> a year, is a <i>new officer</i>, as is
also the <i>Registrar</i>, with a salary of 50<i>l.</i> a
year.&nbsp; These twin-brothers are the legitimate offspring of
the new poor act.&nbsp; To the Registrar is supposed to belong,
to <i>chronicle small beer</i>, &amp;c. and write summonses: if
so, as the defaulters are charged 2<i>s.</i> 4<i>d.</i> for each
summons, are they not, in fact, paid for <i>twice over</i>?</p>
<p><a name="footnote586a"></a><a href="#citation586a"
class="footnote">[586a]</a>&nbsp; Were it, indeed, ascertainable,
that it was Nicholas who taught England and Europe the use of the
Compass, Lynn would have great reason to be proud of him.&nbsp;
But the fact is doubtful, if not more than doubtful, as the same
honour has been confidently ascribed to <i>Flavio Gioia</i>, a
celebrated mathematician of Amalfi, in Naples, who flourished
about 1300, which was somewhat earlier than the other, and who
marked the <i>north-point</i> in the Compass by a <i>flower de
lis</i>, in compliment to the then Neapolitan royal family, which
was a branch of that of France.&nbsp; Still our townsman might
have a share, and that perhaps not small, if not in the discovery
itself, yet, at least, in its improvement, or the application of
it to the purposes of navigation.&nbsp; The <i>Chinese</i> are
said to have been acquainted with magnetism and the use of the
compass long before all other nations.</p>
<p><a name="footnote586b"></a><a href="#citation586b"
class="footnote">[586b]</a>&nbsp; The Astrolabe was an instrument
formerly in much request, and still very well spoken of.&nbsp;
There were different sorts of instruments that bore that
name.&nbsp; The above was one of those called
<i>sea</i>-astrolabes, a description of which may be seen in the
works of <i>Chaucer</i>, and also in the Cyclop&aelig;dias.</p>
<p><a name="footnote587"></a><a href="#citation587"
class="footnote">[587]</a>&nbsp; <i>Bale</i>, however, classes
him among the <i>Carmelites</i>; but it seems to be generally
agreed that he was mistaken, and that Nicholas certainly belonged
to the Franciscans, as was said above.&nbsp; Mackerell imputes
Bale&rsquo;s placing him among the Carmelites to his partiality
to them, having himself been of that fraternity.</p>
<p><a name="footnote590"></a><a href="#citation590"
class="footnote">[590]</a>&nbsp; Which may probably indicate,
that he had been educated at <i>Oxford</i>, as that university
was the great nest, or fountain-head of Lollardism, which seems
not to have been much, if at all countenanced at
Cambridge.&mdash;Abp. Arundel with his commissioners visited
Cambridge in 1401, not long, it seems, after the trial and
burning of Sautre. . . .&nbsp; One, and perhaps the chief object
of their visit was, to enquire, Whether there were among its
members &ldquo;any suspected of Lollardism, or any other
heretical pravity.&rdquo;&nbsp; One solitary Lollard was found
out, whose name was <i>Peter Harford</i>, who was ordered to
abjure Wickliff&rsquo;s opinions in full congregation.&nbsp; (See
Mo. Mag. for Oct. 1803, p. 225.)</p>
<p><a name="footnote592"></a><a href="#citation592"
class="footnote">[592]</a>&nbsp; Let it not be supposed that the
vile prison holes, or places of torment, above spoken of, and
described, were used <i>only</i> by the votaries of popery, or
the roman catholics.&nbsp; Even the member and prelates of the
protestant church of England appear also to have made use of them
before now; and that, too, at what some seem to deem the era of
the utmost evangelical purity of that church&mdash;the reign of
good queen Bess, as she has been often called.&nbsp; As to our
pretended orthodox and evangelical sectaries, if they have not
followed the above example <i>literally</i>, yet have they made,
and still make no scruple of doing it, as we may say,
<i>metaphorically</i> or <i>figuratively</i>, at
least.&mdash;When any one is pronounced by their petty popes,
prelates, priests, exorcists, or consistories, to be possessed
with the demon of heterodoxy or heresy, he is immediately
reviled, defamed, proscribed, and outlawed, at it were, by
proclamation; or pilloried and gibbeted, in their periodical and
other publications&mdash;in other words, they do all they can to
set every body against him, and render him odious in the sight of
all men, as one who has forfeited the esteem of his fellow
citizens, and is no longer worthy of enjoying the common rights
and comforts of society.&mdash;In short, they appear to use all
their efforts and energies to have him effectually secured in a
<i>Little-Ease</i>, of a most painful and dismal sort.&mdash;If
our protestant, orthodox, and evangelical sects and parties do
thus, who can wonder at the cruelties ascribed to the papists in
former times?&nbsp; Instead of inveighing against the intolerant,
persecuting, and antichristian spirit of popery, as these very
people often do, they ought, surely, to consider how little that
spirit differs from their own.&nbsp; While they inveigh or
declaim against the injustice and cruelty of imprisoning,
banishing, hanging, or burning people for their religion, and
yet, at the same time, are in the constant practice of traducing,
reviling, defaming, exhibiting as evil-doers, and treating in the
most unkind and injurious manner, those whom they are pleased to
brand with the name of <i>heretics</i>, or who differ from them,
they discover the self same spirit with the very worst of
persecutors, and may be compared to the ancient sect called
<i>Circonelliones</i>, who would not use the <i>sword</i>,
because Christ had forbidden it to <i>Peter</i>, but armed
themselves with <i>Clubs</i>, which they called <i>the clubs of
Israel</i>, with which they could break all the bones in a
man&rsquo;s skin.&mdash;See Jones&rsquo; Mem. of bishop Horne,
275.</p>
<p><a name="footnote593"></a><a href="#citation593"
class="footnote">[593]</a>&nbsp; The act <i>De H&aelig;retico
Comburendo</i>, did not take place till sometime after; so that
its terrors cannot be supposed to have frightened him to
recantation.&mdash;We can think of nothing so likely to have
produced that effect as some intolerably severe private
sufferings which he had undergone during the above mentioned
interval.</p>
<p><a name="footnote597"></a><a href="#citation597"
class="footnote">[597]</a>&nbsp; That <i>scrole</i> related, it
seems, to the <i>recantation</i>, of which, according to Fox, the
following was the tenor or <i>substance</i>&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>Imprimis</i>, touching the first and
second, [articles] where I said that I would adore rather a
temporall prince, and the lively bodies of the saints, than the
wooden crosse whereupon the Lord did hang, I do revoke and recant
the same, as being therein deceived.&mdash;To this I say, that
the article is false and erroneous, and by false information I
held it; the which I renounce and ask forgiveness thereof, and
say, that is a precious relique, and that I shall hold it while I
live, and that I sweare here.&mdash;I know well that I erred
wrongfully by false information: for I wot well, that a deacon or
a priest is more bound to say his mattens and houres then to
preach; for there he is bounden by right: wherefore I submit me,
&amp;c.&mdash;Touching that article, I know right well that I
erred by false information.&nbsp; Wherefore I ask
forgiveness.&mdash;As concerning vowes, I say that opinion is
false and erroneous, and by false information I held it; for a
man is holden to hold his vow, &amp;c.&mdash;To the 7. article I
say, that I did it by authority of priesthood, wherethrough I
knowledge well that I have guilt and trespassed: wherefore I
submit me to God and to holy church, and to you father, swearing
that I shall never hold it more.&mdash;To the 8. (article) I say,
that I held it by false and wrong information.&nbsp; But now I
know well that it is heresie, and that bread, anon as the word of
the sacrament is said, is no longer bread materiall, but that it
is turned into very Christ&rsquo;s body; and that I sweare
here.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Two more articles were then retracted by him, and pronounced
to be <i>false and erroneous</i>, &amp;c. but it does not appear
what they were, (see Fox, 1. 674.)&mdash;This recantation,
throughout, exhibits evident symptoms of a man so overcome by his
fears, or his sufferings, as to be ready to say or do any that
his unfeeling persecutors should prescribe or dictate to
him.&mdash;He appeared much more fearless and intrepid,
afterwards, when he was taken up the last time, tried before the
arch-bishop and convocation, condemned and committed to the
flames.</p>
<p><a name="footnote598"></a><a href="#citation598"
class="footnote">[598]</a>&nbsp; Fox A. and M. 1. 673.</p>
<p><a name="footnote599"></a><a href="#citation599"
class="footnote">[599]</a>&nbsp; The Londoners were then
distinguished for their partiality to the Lollards; which may, in
some measure, account for the facility with which Sawtre appears
to have obtained the appointment or situation of minister of St.
Osith.&mdash;see <i>Fox</i>, 670.</p>
<p><a name="footnote600"></a><a href="#citation600"
class="footnote">[600]</a>&nbsp; The celebrated Sir William Jones
is well known to have been one of our most earnest and warm
friends and advocates of reform.&nbsp; The memorable Dr.
<i>Johnson</i> used to call him, <i>the most enlightened of the
sons of men</i>.</p>
<p><a name="footnote603"></a><a href="#citation603"
class="footnote">[603]</a>&nbsp; Fox A. and M. 671, 672.</p>
<p><a name="footnote604"></a><a href="#citation604"
class="footnote">[604]</a>&nbsp; One circumstance, mentioned as
having occurred in the course of this examination, seems not a
little difficult to account for.&nbsp; Fox says, that Arundel
enquired of Sawtre, &ldquo;Whether he had abjured the foresaid
heresies and errors objected against him before the bishop of
Norwich, or not; or else had revoked and renounced the said or
such like conclusions or articles, or not?&rdquo; and that the
latter answered and affirmed that he had not. [p. 672.]&nbsp;
Also four days after, when the fore-cited process of the bishop
of Norwich was read to him before the convocation, and it was
urged that he had then abjured, among other errors, the heresy,
that in the sacrament of the altar, after the consecration made
by the priest, there still remained material bread,
&ldquo;Whereunto the said William, answered, smiling, or in
mocking wise, and denying that he knew of the
premisses.&rdquo;&nbsp; [Ib. p. 674.]&nbsp; In all this there is
evidently some mystery, which one knows not how to unravel,
except on the supposition, that there was some material mistake,
or designed misrepresentation in the statement which bishop
Spencer sent to the convocation of his process against Sawtre,
and of the tenor of the latter&rsquo;s retraction, which might,
in his opinion, justify his said denial.</p>
<p><a name="footnote605"></a><a href="#citation605"
class="footnote">[605]</a>&nbsp; He might well answer
<i>deridingly</i>, for such interrogations were fit only to
excite contempt and derision.</p>
<p><a name="footnote606"></a><a href="#citation606"
class="footnote">[606]</a>&nbsp; See Fox 673, who gives the
following as a copy of the said sentence&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>In the Name of God</i>,
<i>Amen</i>.&nbsp; We Thomas by the grace of God archbishop of
Canterbury, primate of England, and Legate of the See
Apostolicall, <i>by the authority of God almighty</i>, and
blessed Saint <i>Peter</i> and <i>Paul</i>, and of <i>holy
church</i>, and <i>by our own authority</i>, sitting for
tribunall or chiefe judge, <i>having God alone before our
eyes</i>, by the counsell and consent of the whole clergie, our
fellow bretheren and suffragans, assistants to us in this present
councell provinciall, by this our sentence definitive do
pronounce, decree, and declare by these presents, thee William
Sautre, otherwise colled Chawtrey, parish priest pretensed,
personally appearing before us, in and upon the crime of heresie,
judicially and lawfully convict, as an heretike, and as an
heretike be punished.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="footnote607"></a><a href="#citation607"
class="footnote">[607]</a>&nbsp; See Fox, p. 674. where we find a
copy of this second sentence, or sentence of degradation, in the
following words . . .</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<i>In the Name of God</i>,
<i>Amen</i>.&nbsp; Wee Thomas by the grace of God archbishop of
Canterbury, Legate of the See Apostolicall, and metropolitan of
all England, doe find and declare, that thou William Sautre,
otherwise called Chautris, priest, by us with the counsell and
assent of all and singular our fellow brethren and whole clergy,
by this our sentence definitive declared in writing, hast beene
for heresie convict and condemned, and art (being againe fallen
into heresie) to be deposed and degraded by these
presents.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="footnote608"></a><a href="#citation608"
class="footnote">[608]</a>&nbsp; But its absurdity seems of an
opposite cast to that of one our late parliaments, which
undertook to establish the popish doctrine of the <i>indelibility
of the priestly</i>, <i>or clerical character</i>, than which
neither the above process, nor even transubstantiation itself,
can be more absurd or ridiculous.&nbsp; That such a doctrine
should really be recognised, adopted, and established by the
British Senate, now in the 19th century, might have occasioned no
small astonishment, had not the same august body, within the same
period, done so many other things equally strange, marvellous,
and disreputable.&nbsp; Should we become inquisitive, and presume
to ask, What is this invisible, mysterious, indelible something,
called character; the episcopal, priestly, or clerical
<i>character</i>? some will tell us, that it is a <i>spiritual
power</i>, others a <i>habit</i> or <i>disposition</i>, others a
<i>spiritual figure</i>, others a <i>sensible metaphorical
quality</i>, others a <i>real relation</i>, others a <i>fabric of
the mind</i>: by all which, little more, perhaps, can be made
out, or comprehended, than that the advocates or supporters of
the doctrine are much at variance about this character.&nbsp; But
however they may differ in their ideas and definitions of the
character itself, they are, it seems, in perfect agreement as to
its indelibility; being all firmly persuaded, that though a
bishop, priest, or deacon, turn heretic; or schismatic, deist or
atheist, he still retains the character; and though not a
christian man, he is still a christian bishop, priest, or deacon:
though he be degraded and excommunicated, he is in respect to the
character still the same.&nbsp; Though he be cut off from the
church, he is still a minister in the church.&nbsp; In such a
situation, to perform any of the sacred functions would be in him
a deadly sin, but these would be equally valid as before.&nbsp;
Thus he may not be within the pale of the church himself, and yet
be in the church as a minister of Jesus Christ.&nbsp; He may
openly and solemnly blaspheme God, and abjure the faith of
Christ; he may apostatize to Judaism, to Mahometism, to Paganism,
he still retains the character.&nbsp; He may even become a priest
of Jupiter, or a priest of Baal, and still continue a priest of
Jesus Christ.&nbsp; The character say the Schoolmen, is not
cancelled even in the <i>damned</i>, but remains with the wicked
to their disgrace and greater confusion; so that in hell they are
the ministers of Jesus Christ, and messengers of the new
covenant!! [see the late Dr. Campbell&rsquo;s Lectures on
Ecclesiastical History, for a more full and striking view of this
subject.]&nbsp; That our legislature, in sanctioning the said
doctrine, did really mean to go the whole length the Schoolmen
did, or adopt all their ideas concerning it, may, perhaps, admit
of some doubt: but after agreeing with them in the main point, it
might be thought hardly worth their while to hesitate about the
smaller matters.&nbsp; Be this as it may, the convocation over
which archbishop Arundel presided, in the process against Sawtre,
seem to have been entirely of a different opinion, both from she
Schoolmen and our said late parliament, on this notable question
of clerical indelibility.</p>
<p><a name="footnote610"></a><a href="#citation610"
class="footnote">[610]</a>&nbsp; The sentence printed in italics
is given in <i>Latin</i> by Fox.</p>
<p><a name="footnote613"></a><a href="#citation613"
class="footnote">[613]</a>&nbsp; If there be any one thing more
detestable than the rest among the proceedings of Arundel and his
inquisitorial associates, against Sawtre, it is their affecting
to feel for him, or commiserate his case and recommend him to the
<i>favour</i> of the secular power, at the very time when they
were delivering him up as a sheep to the slaughter (or to the
butcher) or as a victim for immediate immolation.&nbsp; They felt
no pity for him, and knew that the magistrate would shew him no
favour.&mdash;The judges of the <i>Inquisition</i> also are said
always to express much tenderness and goodwill towards those they
condemn to the flames.&mdash;Our <i>protestant and pretended
evangelical sects</i>, likewise, are often heard to use the
language of kindness and pity towards those whom they have
pronounced to be <i>heretics</i>, at the same time they are doing
all they can to render them odious in the eyes of all men, and,
deprive them of the kind offices and good opinion of all their
fellow-citizens.</p>

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
